# Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack

This topic lists the Windows PowerShell modules included with Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack (MDOP). The modules in the list support automating features of those components and provide links to the cmdlet references for each module. These modules enable you to use cmdlets to administer, maintain, configure, and develop new features for MDOP.
