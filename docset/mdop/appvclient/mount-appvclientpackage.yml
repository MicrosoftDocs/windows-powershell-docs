### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Loads a package into the App-V cache.
module: AppVClient
notes: |-
  * If a previous mount has been cancelled, the cmdlet resumes that mount when run again. The package must be added to the system before mounting, otherwise the cmdlet fails. If you do not specify any parameters, the cmdlet mounts all packages on the system.
  * This cmdlet is synchronous. It will return once the mount option has completed. To make the cmdlet asynchronous, use the **Start-Job** cmdlet.
