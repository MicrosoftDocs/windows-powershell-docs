# Send-AppvClientReport

## SYNOPSIS
Sends reporting data from the client.

## SYNTAX

```
Send-AppvClientReport [-NetworkCostAware] [-DeleteOnSuccess] [[-URL] <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Send-AppVClientReport** cmdlet sends all the available reporting data to the specified location in XML format.
You can delete the data from the client.
Reporting must be enabled.
By default, the data will be sent to the location that is listed in the **ReportingServer** registry value.
This value can be either an UNC Share or the name of the Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) Reporting Server.
To override this location, you can specify a location by using the *URL* parameter.
The location can be either an UNC share or the App-V Reporting Server location.

By default, once the data is sent, the data is not deleted from the client and will be sent to the reporting server as part of the next scheduled sync, if applicable.
You can specify to delete the data from the client.
If the *DeleteOnSuccess* parameter is specified, the reporting data is deleted from the client.

If the data is successfully sent, a success message is displayed.

The cmdlet fails if reporting is not enabled.

The cmdlet fails if there is no valid location specified.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Send data to previously configured location
```
PS C:\> Send-AppVClientReport
The Application Virtualization Client Report was sent successfully
```

This command sends the data to the location that is configured in the client and does not delete the data after sending.

### Example 2: Send data to previously configured location and delete data
```
PS C:\> Send-AppVClientReport -DeleteOnSuccess
Tee Application Virtualization Client Report was sent successfully
```

This command sends the data to the location that is configured in the client and deletes the data after sending.

### Example 3: Send data to specified location and delete data
```
PS C:\> Send-AppVClientReport -URL "http://myreportingserver:port" -DeleteOnSuccess
The Application Virtualization Client Report was sent successfully
```

This command sends the data to the location specified by the URL parameter and deletes the data after sending.

### Example 4: Send data to incorrect location
```
PS C:\> Send-AppVClientReport -URL "http://incorrectservername:port" -DeleteOnSuccess
The reporting server or share location has not been specified.  You must specify the reporting server or share location using the following format: -Url <location>
```

This command tries to send the data to the location specified by the URL parameter but since the server name is incorrect, the sending action fails and an error is returned.
The data is not deleted.
