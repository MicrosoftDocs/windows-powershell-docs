name: Read-ADRecoveryInformation
description: |-
  The **Read-ADRecoveryInformation** cmdlet gets BitLocker volume recovery data from an Active Directory computer object and child **msFVE-RecoveryInformation** objects or performs a search to retrieve this data from multiple computer objects.
  The *Server* parameter is required and specifies the server hosting a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) service for the target domain.
  The search for computer objects is not recursive.
  A search is performed in the Active Directory path specified by the *SearchBase* parameter.
  The default value of the *SearchBase* parameter is the default naming context of the target domain.
  You can also use the *SearchBase* parameter to set the full path of a single computer object.
