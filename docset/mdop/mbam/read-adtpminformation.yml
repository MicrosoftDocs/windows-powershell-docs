    This command queries for TpmOwnerInformation records corresponding to each computer object in the container "OU=Workstations,OU=Machines,DC=Contoso,DC=com" (not including sub-containers).

    The Active Directory query is performed as a user named Contoso.com\adpullreader.

    Each returned record is an instance of **PsObject** with name of the computer, the TPM owner authorization string, and the time at which it was backed up to Active Directory (if known).

- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ResultPageSize
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of objects the server should return in a single page of results.
    The default is 1000, which is the default server MaxPageSize limit.
    If you change the server MaxPageSize to a value less than 1000, that value will take precedence over this parameter.Changing this value can be useful to throttling network bandwidth and reducing the LDAP server memory footprint required to service this query.

description: |-
  The **Read-ADTpmInformation** cmdlet gets Trusted Platform Module (TPM) owner information from an Active Directory computer object or linked **msTPM-InformationObject** or performs a search to retrieve this data for multiple computers. 
  The *Server* parameter is required and specifies the Active Directory Domain Services instance to connect to.
  The search is not recursive.
  A search for computer objects is performed in the Active Directory path specified by the *SearchBase* parameter.
  The default value of the *SearchBase* parameter is the default naming context of the target domain.
  You can also set the *SearchBase* parameter to the full path of a single computer object.
