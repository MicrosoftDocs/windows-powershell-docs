# New-NetworkControllerRouteTable

## SYNOPSIS

This cmdlet creates a new route table in the Network Controller

## SYNTAX

```
New-NetworkControllerRouteTable -ConnectionUri <Uri> -Properties <RouteTableProperties> -ResourceId <string>
 [-CertificateThumbPrint <string>] [-Credential <PSCredential>] [-Etag <string>] [-Force]
 [-ResourceMetadata <ResourceMetadata>] [-Tags <psobject>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
This cmdlet creates a new route table in the Network Controller.
If you want to route traffic to virtual appliances in your environment, you can specify routes and associate them to a virtual subnet.
Subnets rely on system routes until a route table is associated to the subnet.
After an association exists, routing is done based on Longest Prefix Match (LPM) among both user defined routes and system routes. 
If there is more than one route with the same LPM match, then the user defined route is selected first - before the system route.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```
$route = new-object Microsoft.Windows.NetworkController.Route
$route.ResourceID = "0_0_0_0_0"
$route.properties = new-object Microsoft.Windows.NetworkController.RouteProperties
$route.properties.AddressPrefix = "0.0.0.0/0"
$route.properties.nextHopType = "VirtualAppliance"
$route.properties.nextHopIpAddress = "192.168.1.10"
$routetableproperties.routes += $route
New-NetworkControllerRouteTable -ConnectionUri https://networkcontroller -ResourceId "Route1" -Properties $routetableproperties
```

Description



The above cmdlet creates a route table named Route1 with a single route named "0_0_0_0_0"

## PARAMETERS

### -CertificateThumbPrint
Specifies the digital public key X.509 certificate of a user account that has permission to perform this action.

```yaml
Type: string
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False

Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False

Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Properties
Each route table can have multiple routes.
Each route has the following properties:
1.
Address prefix
2.
Next hop type
3.
Next hop IP address

```yaml
Type: RouteTableProperties
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ResourceId
Specifies the ID of the route table to be created
