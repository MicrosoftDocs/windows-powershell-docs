# New-CertificateNotificationTask

## SYNOPSIS
Creates a new task in the Task Scheduler that will be triggered when a certificate is replaced, expired, or about to expired.

## SYNTAX

```
New-CertificateNotificationTask -Type <CertificateNotificationType> [-RunTaskForExistingCertificates]
 -PSScript <String> -Name <String> -Channel <NotificationChannel> [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **New-CertificateNotificationTask** cmdlet creates a new task in the Task Scheduler that will be triggered when a certificate is replaced or expires.
The task will launch the script specified by the **PSScript** parameter.

If the **RunTaskForExistingCertificates** parameter is specified, then after this cmdlet is registered, the cmdlet will go through all certificates (including archived certificates) in the My store and initiate Replace events for all certificates with a Renewal property.
The NewCertHash value will always be the one at the end of the renewal chain.
For example; if certificate A was renewed to certificate B, which was then renewed to certificate C, then the cmdlet fires two events: certificate A to certificate C and certificate B to certificate C.
This will ensure that applications that are still using old certificates are properly updated to the newest certificates.
If any certificate has a renewal chain longer than 20, then the certificate is not logged.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
PS C:\>New-CertificateNotificationTask -PSScript C:\myscript.ps1 -Channel System -Type Replace -Name "My System Certificate Task"
```

This example creates a system notification task for certificate replacement events with the name My System Certificate Task that will launch the myscript.ps1 script located on the C: drive.
The cmdlet will run on the local system.

### EXAMPLE 2
```
PS C:\>New-CertificateNotificationTask -PSScript C:\myscript.ps1 -Channel User -Type Expire -Name "My User Certificate Task"
```

This example creates a system notification task for the expiration and close-to-expiration certificate events with the name My User Certificate Task that will launch the myscript.ps1 script located on the C: drive.
The cmdlet will run for all currently logged on users in the user contexts.

## PARAMETERS

### -Channel
Sets the channel of the CertificateServicesClient-Notifications log that will be monitored for certificate lifecycle events.
The acceptable values for this parameter are:

 -- System:  The Operation-System channel will be used.
