## DESCRIPTION
The **Remove-CertificateEnrollmentPolicyServer** cmdlet removes an enrollment policy server from the current user or local computer configuration.
This cmdlet also removes any policy cache file and credentials from the vault.

Only one enrollment policy server configuration is removed from the user configured location at a time. 

If a scope of All is specified and the same URL exists in the local computer (machine) and User contexts, then this cmdlet will fail. 

An error is generated if the specified URL does not exist in the given scope. 

Any policy cache file and credentials are also removed from the vault.
