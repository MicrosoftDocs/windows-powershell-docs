  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="ADAuthType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AuthType
  description: |+
    Specifies the authentication method to use.
    Possible values for this parameter include:

    Negotiate or 0

    Basic or 1

    The default authentication method is Negotiate.

    A Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection is required for the Basic authentication method.

    The following example shows how to set this parameter to Basic.

    -AuthType Basic

  defaultValue: Microsoft.ActiveDirectory.Management.AuthType.Negotiate
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Negotiate, Basic
- type: <xref href="PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Credential
  description: |+
    Specifies the user account credentials to use to perform this task.
    The default credentials are the credentials of the currently logged on user unless the cmdlet is run from an Active Directory PowerShell provider drive.
    If the cmdlet is run from such a provider drive, the account associated with the drive is the default.

    To specify this parameter, you can type a user name, such as "User1" or "Domain01\User01" or you can specify a PSCredential object.
    If you specify a user name for this parameter, the cmdlet prompts for a password.

    You can also create a PSCredential object by using a script or by using the Get-Credential cmdlet.
    You can then set the Credential parameter to the PSCredential object The following example shows how to create credentials.

    $AdminCredentials = Get-Credential "Domain01\User01"

    The following shows how to set the Credential parameter to these credentials.

    -Credential $AdminCredentials

    If the acting credentials do not have directory-level permission to perform the task, Active Directory PowerShell returns a terminating error.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ADFineGrainedPasswordPolicy" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an Active Directory fine-grained password policy object by providing one of the following property values.
    The identifier in parentheses is the LDAP display name for the attribute.

    Distinguished Name (distinguishedName)

    Example: CN=Strict Password Policy,CN=Password Settings Container,CN=System,DC=corp,DC=contoso,DC=com

    GUID (objectGUID)

    Example: 599c3d2e-f72d-4d20-8a88-030d99495f20

    Name (name)

    Example: PasswordPolicyLevel1

    The cmdlet searches the default naming context or partition to find the object.
    If two or more objects are found, the cmdlet returns a non-terminating error.

    This parameter can also get this object through the pipeline or you can set this parameter to a fine-grained password policy object instance.

    This example shows how to set the parameter to a distinguished name.

    -Identity "CN=Strict Password Policy,CN=Password Settings Container,CN=System,DC=corp,DC=contoso,DC=com"

    This example shows how to set this parameter to a fine-grained password policy object instance named "fineGrainedPasswordPolicyInstance".

    -Identity $fineGrainedPasswordPolicyInstance

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Server
  description: |+
    Specifies the Active Directory Domain Services instance to connect to, by providing one of the following values for a corresponding domain name or directory server.
    The service may be any of the following:  Active Directory Lightweight Domain Services, Active Directory Domain Services or Active Directory Snapshot instance.

    Domain name values:

    Fully qualified domain name

    Examples: corp.contoso.com

    NetBIOS name

    Example: CORP

    Directory server values:

    Fully qualified directory server name

    Example: corp-DC12.corp.contoso.com

    NetBIOS name

    Example: corp-DC12

    Fully qualified directory server name and port

    Example: corp-DC12.corp.contoso.com:3268

    The default value for the Server parameter is determined by one of the following methods in the order that they are listed:

    -By using Server value from objects passed through the pipeline.

    -By using the server information associated with the Active Directory PowerShell provider drive, when running under that drive.

    -By using the domain of the computer running Windows PowerShell.

    The following example shows how to specify a full qualified domain name as the parameter value.

    -Server "corp.contoso.com"

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: ActiveDirectory.Get-ADFineGrainedPasswordPolicySubject
name: Get-ADFineGrainedPasswordPolicySubject
description: |-
  The Get- ADFineGrainedPasswordPolicySubject cmdlet gets users and groups that are subject to a fine grained password policy.

  The Identity parameter specifies the fine grained password policy.
  You can identify a fine grained password policy by its distinguished name, GUID or name.
  You can also set the Identity parameter to a fine grained password policy object variable, such as $\<localPasswordPolicyObject\>, or pass a fine grained password policy object through the pipeline to the Identity parameter.
  For example, you can use the Get-ADFineGrainedPasswordPolicy cmdlet to retrieve a fine grained password policy object and then pass the object through the pipeline to the Get- ADFineGrainedPasswordPolicySubject cmdlet.
