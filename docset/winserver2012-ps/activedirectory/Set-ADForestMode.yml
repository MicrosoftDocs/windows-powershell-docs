parameters:
- type: <xref href="ADAuthType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AuthType
  description: |+
    Specifies the authentication method to use.
    Possible values for this parameter include:

    Negotiate or 0

    Basic or 1

    The default authentication method is Negotiate.

    A Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection is required for the Basic authentication method.

    The following example shows how to set this parameter to Basic.

    -AuthType Basic

  defaultValue: Microsoft.ActiveDirectory.Management.AuthType.Negotiate
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Negotiate, Basic
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Credential
  description: |+
    Specifies the user account credentials to use to perform this task.
    The default credentials are the credentials of the currently logged on user unless the cmdlet is run from an Active Directory PowerShell provider drive.
    If the cmdlet is run from such a provider drive, the account associated with the drive is the default.

    To specify this parameter, you can type a user name, such as "User1" or "Domain01\User01" or you can specify a PSCredential object.
    If you specify a user name for this parameter, the cmdlet prompts for a password.

    You can also create a PSCredential object by using a script or by using the Get-Credential cmdlet.
    You can then set the Credential parameter to the PSCredential object The following example shows how to create credentials.

    $AdminCredentials = Get-Credential "Domain01\User01"

    The following shows how to set the Credential parameter to these credentials.

    -Credential $AdminCredentials

    If the acting credentials do not have directory-level permission to perform the task, Active Directory PowerShell returns a terminating error.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ADForestMode" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ForestMode
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the forest mode for an Active Directory forest.
    The possible values for this parameter are:   Windows2000Forest or 0

    Windows2003InterimForest or 1

    Windows2003Forest or 2

    Windows2008Forest or 3

    Windows2008R2Forest or 4

    The values are listed in order of functionality from least to most.

    The following example shows how to set this parameter.

    -ForestMode Windows2008R2Forest

  defaultValue: None
  position: "2"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Windows2000Forest, Windows2003InterimForest, Windows2003Forest, Windows2008Forest, Windows2008R2Forest, Windows2012Forest, UnknownForest
- type: <xref href="ADForest" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an Active Directory forest object by providing one of the following attribute values.
    The identifier in parentheses is the LDAP display name for the attribute.

    Fully qualified domain name

    Example: corp.contoso.com

    GUID (objectGUID)

    Example: 599c3d2e-f72d-4d20-8a88-030d99495f20

    DNS host name

    Example: dnsServer.corp.contoso.com

    NetBIOS name

    Example: corp

    The cmdlet searches the default naming context or partition to find the object.
    If two or more objects are found, the cmdlet returns a non-terminating error.

    This parameter can also get this object through the pipeline or you can set this parameter to a forest object instance.

    This example shows how to set the parameter to a fully qualified domain name.

    -Identity "corp.contoso.com"

    This example shows how to set this parameter to a forest object instance named "forestInstance".

    -Identity $forestInstance

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PassThru
  description: |+
    Returns the new or modified object.
    By default (i.e.
    if -PassThru is not specified), this cmdlet does not generate any output.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Server
  description: |+

    The service may be any of the following:  Active Directory Lightweight Domain Services, Active Directory Domain Services or Active Directory Snapshot instance.

    Domain name values:

    Fully qualified domain name

    Examples: corp.contoso.com

    NetBIOS name

    Example: CORP

    Directory server values:

    Fully qualified directory server name

    Example: corp-DC12.corp.contoso.com

    NetBIOS name

    Example: corp-DC12

    Fully qualified directory server name and port

    Example: corp-DC12.corp.contoso.com:3268

    The default value for the Server parameter is determined by one of the following methods in the order that they are listed:

    -By using Server value from objects passed through the pipeline.

    -By using the server information associated with the Active Directory PowerShell provider drive, when running under that drive.

    -By using the domain of the computer running Powershell.

    The following example shows how to specify a full qualified domain name as the parameter value.

    -Server "corp.contoso.com"

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf

    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: wi
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: ActiveDirectory.Set-ADForestMode
name: Set-ADForestMode
description: |-
  The Set-ADForestMode cmdlet sets the Forest mode for an Active Directory forest.
  You specify the forest mode by setting the ForestMode parameter.
  The forest mode can be set to the following values that are listed in order of functionality from lowest to highest.

  Windows2000Forest

  Windows2003InterimForest

  Windows2003Forest

  Windows2008Forest

  Windows2008R2Forest

  The Identity parameter specifies the Active Directory forest to modify.
  You can identify a forest by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN), GUID, DNS host name, or NetBIOS name.
  You can also specify the forest by passing a forest object through the pipeline.
  For example, you can use the Get-ADForest cmdlet to retrieve a forest object and then pass the object through the pipeline to the Set-ADForestMode.

  Set-ADForestMode will prompt for confirmation by default.
