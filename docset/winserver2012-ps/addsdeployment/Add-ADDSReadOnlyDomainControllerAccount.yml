### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Creates a read-only domain controller (RODC) account that can be used to install an RODC in Active Directory.
module: ADDSDeployment
notes: |-
  * Once you have added the RODC account, you can add an RODC to a server computer by using the **Install-ADDSDomainController** cmdlet with the **-ReadOnlyReplica** switch parameter.
  * You can also delegate the ability to attach the server to a non-administrative group or user. If you are deploying RODCs in delegated administration scenarios where the machine accounts are pre-provisioned, creating the RODC account is the first stage of the RODC installation process and needs to be done by a member of the Domain Admins group. In these scenarios, once an administrator uses this cmdlet to add the RODC account in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), the second stage of the installation can occur. This involves attaching an actual server computer in a remote location (such as a branch office) that will operate as the RODC for the specified account created using this cmdlet.

  description: |+
    Specifies the names of user accounts, group accounts, and computer accounts whose passwords can be replicated to this RODC.
    Use "None" if you want to keep the value empty.
    By default, only the Allowed RODC Password Replication Group is allowed, and it is originally created empty.

- type: <xref href="PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Credential
  description: |+
    Specifies the user name and password that corresponds to the account used to install the domain controller.
    Specify "(get-credential)" when using this parameter to prompt the user to supply a password.

  name: DenyPasswordReplicationAccountName
  description: |+
    Specifies the names of user accounts, group accounts, and computer accounts whose passwords are not to be replicated to this RODC.
    Use "None" if you do not want to deny the replication of credentials of any users or computers.
    By default, Administrators, Server Operators, Backup Operators, Account Operators, and the Denied RODC Password Replication Group are denied.
    By default, the Denied RODC Password Replication Group includes Cert Publishers, Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins, Enterprise Domain Controllers, Enterprise Read-Only Domain Controllers, Group Policy Creator Owners, the krbtgt account, and Schema Admins.

  defaultValue: "NULL"

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainName
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the domain name for the user name (account credentials) for the operation.
    This parameter is required.
    It also helps to specify the forest where you plan to install the domain controller or create an RODC account.

  name: InstallDns
  description: |+

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />

  name: SkipPreChecks
  description: |+
    Specifies that only a base set of validations will be performed when this cmdlet is executed.
    This behavior is equivalent to the validations that were performed when using Dcpromo.exe in earlier versions of Windows Server to add a domain controller.
    When this switch parameter is set, it specifies that additional preliminary checks should be bypassed.
    For more information on the scope of these additional preliminary checks that the ADDSDeployment module performs by default when using Windows Server 2012, refer to the table in the section "Prerequisite Checking" in the Understand and Troubleshoot AD DS Simplified Administration in Windows Server 2012 guide located at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=237244.
