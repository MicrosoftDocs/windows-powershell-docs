  description: |-
    The `Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure.CimInstance` object is a wrapper class that displays Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) objects.
    The path after the pound sign (`#`) provides the namespace and class name for the underlying WMI object.

parameters:

  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 

    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt. 
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes. 
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets. 
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/cimcmdlets/new-cimsession) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.

- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  name: Volume
  description: |+
    Specifies one or more file system volumes for which to scan and compute fresh data deduplication savings information.
    Enter one or more volume IDs, drive letters (such as `D:`), or volume GUID pathnames (using the form `\\\\?\Volume{{GUID}}\\`).
    Separate multiple volumes with a comma.

description: "The **Update-DedupStatus** cmdlet scans one or more specified volumes to compute fresh data deduplication savings information.\r\nThis cmdlet returns a DeduplicationStatus object.\r\nFor quick access to cached metadata use Get-DedupStatus.\r\nWhen this cmdlet is run on multiple volumes with one cmdlet call, the analysis for each volume is done serially.\r\n\r\nNote: On large volumes this cmdlet can run for several minutes and will always perform a rescan after the initial scan.\r\nThe default behavior is to wait for completion, regardless of the length of time required to run the scan and rescan.\r\n\r\nTo run this cmdlet, you must start Windows PowerShell® with the **Run as administrator** option.\r\n\r\nThis cmdlet returns the following metadata: \r\n\r\n                      \r\n - DedupSavedSpace: Saved space is the difference between the logical size of the optimized files and the logical size of the store (the deduplicated user data plus data deduplication metadata).\r\nThis number will change continually. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n - DedupRate: Data deduplication rate is the ratio of data deduplication saved space to the logical size of all of the files on the volume and is expressed in percentage.\r\nThis number will change continually. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n - OptimizedFilesCount: Optimized files count is the number of optimized files on the specified volume.\r\nNote that this number will remain steady (instead of decrease) as users delete files from, or add files to, the volume-until a garbage collection job is run.\r\nThis count is most accurate after a garbage collection job runs. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n - OptimizedFilesSize: Optimized files size is the aggregate size of all optimized files on the specified volume.\r\nNote that this number will remain steady (instead of decrease) as users delete files from, or add new files to, the volume-until a garbage collection job is run.\r\nThis number is most accurate after a garbage collection job runs. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n - InPolicyFilesCount: In policy files count is the number of files that currently qualify for optimization.\r\nThis number will stay relatively constant between optimization jobs. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n - InPolicyFilesSize: In policy files size is the aggregate size of all files that currently qualify for optimization.\r\nThis number will stay relatively constant between optimization jobs. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n - LastOptimizationTime: Last optimization time specifies the data and time when an optimization job was run last on the specified volume.\r\nThis date and time will stay constant between optimization jobs. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n - LastGarbageCollectionTime: Last garbage collection time specifies the data and time when a garbage collection job was run last on the specified volume.\r\nThis date and time will stay constant between optimization jobs. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n - LastScrubbingTime: Last scrubbing time specifies the data and time when a scrubbing job was run last on the specified volume.\r\nThis date and time will stay constant between optimization jobs."
