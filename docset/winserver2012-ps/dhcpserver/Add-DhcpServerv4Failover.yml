description: |-
  The **Add-DhcpServerv4Failover** cmdlet adds a new IPv4 failover relationship to a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server service.
  The first parameter set adds a failover relationship with load balance mode.
  The second parameter set adds the failover relationship in hot-standby mode.

  This cmdlet creates the failover relationship on both of the DHCP server services with the specified parameters.
  The **ScopeId** parameter value specified on the source DHCP server service, or local computer running the DHCP server service is identically setup on the partner DHCP server service.

  If the **SharedSecret** parameter is specified, message digest authentication will be automatically turned on for the newly created failover relationship.

  By default, user confirmation will be sought if the **SharedSecret** parameter is specified.
