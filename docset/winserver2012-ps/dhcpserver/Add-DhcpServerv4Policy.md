# Add-DhcpServerv4Policy

## SYNOPSIS
Adds a new policy either at the server level or at the scope level.

## SYNTAX

```
Add-DhcpServerv4Policy [-Name] <String> [-Condition] <String> [-AsJob] [-CimSession <CimSession[]>]
 [-CircuitId <String[]>] [-ClientId <String[]>] [-ComputerName <String>] [-Description <String>]
 [-Enabled <Boolean>] [-MacAddress <String[]>] [-PassThru] [-ProcessingOrder <UInt16>] [-RelayAgent <String[]>]
 [-RemoteId <String[]>] [-ScopeId <IPAddress>] [-SubscriberId <String[]>] [-ThrottleLimit <Int32>]
 [-UserClass <String[]>] [-VendorClass <String[]>] [-Confirm] [-WhatIf]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Add-DhcpServerv4Policy** cmdlet adds a new policy either at the server level or at the scope level.
The policy name must be unique at the level, either server or specific scope, where the policy is added and should have at least one condition as specified by the **VendorClass**, **UserClass**, **MACAddress**, **ClientId**, **RelayAgent**, **CircuitId**, **RemoteId**, or **SubscriberId** parameter.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
PS C:\>Add-DhcpServerv4Policy -Name HyperVPolicy -Condition OR -MacAddress EQ,00155D*,000569*
```

This example creates a server level policy for virtual machine (VM) clients.
The MAC addresses of Hyper-V VMs (00-15-5D) and VMWare VMs (00-05-69) are used as a condition in the policy.

### EXAMPLE 2
```
PS C:\>Add-DhcpServerv4Policy -Name PhysicalComputersPolicy -Condition OR -MacAddress NE,00155D*,000569*
```

This example creates a server level policy for non-Hyper-V clients.
The MAC address of Hyper-V VMs (`00-15-5D`) and VMware VMs (`000569`) is used as a negation condition in the policy.

### EXAMPLE 3
```
PS C:\>Add-DhcpServerv4Policy -Name VMPolicy -ScopeId 10.10.10.0 -Condition OR -MacAddress EQ,00155D*,000569*
```

This example creates a scope level policy for virtual machine (VM) clients inside the scope 10.10.10.0.
The MAC addresses of Hyper-V VMs (00-15-5D) and VMware VMs (00-05-69) are used as a condition in the policy.

### EXAMPLE 4
```
PS C:\>Add-DhcpServerv4Policy -Name PrinterPolicy -ScopeId 10.10.10.0 -Condition OR -VendorClass EQ,"HP Printer","Xerox Printer"
```

This example creates a printer policy inside the scope 10.10.10.0 based on the vendor class of printers.
The vendor classes need to be defined before being used in the policy.

### EXAMPLE 5
```
PS C:\>Add-DhcpServerv4Policy -Name LabComputerPolicy -ScopeId 10.10.10.0 -Condition OR -UserClass EQ,LabComputers
```

This example creates a lab computers policy inside the scope 10.10.10.0 based on the user class.
The user class needs to be defined before being used in the policy.

### EXAMPLE 6
```
PS C:\>Add-DhcpServerv4Policy -Name RelayAgentBasedPolicy -ScopeId 10.10.10.0 -Condition OR -RelayAgent EQ,01030a0b0c02050000000123
```

This example creates a policy based on the relay agent information (option 82) inside the scope 10.10.10.0.
The DHCP relay agent needs to be configured with the relay agent information option (option 82).

### EXAMPLE 7
```
PS C:\>Add-DhcpServerv4Policy -Name DevicesPolicy -ScopeId 10.10.10.0 -Condition OR -MacAddress EQ,F8DB7F* -VendorClass EQ,Android
```

This example creates a policy by combining conditions, using OR, based on MAC address prefix of HTC phone devices and vendor class of Android, inside the scope 10.10.10.0.
The vendor class needs to be defined before being used in the policy.

### EXAMPLE 8
```
PS C:\>Add-DhcpServerv4Policy -Name HyperVPolicy -Condition OR -MacAddress EQ,00155D*,000569* -ProcessingOrder 2 -Enabled False
```

This example creates a server level policy for virtual machine (VM) clients and assigns a processing order and creates the policy in a disabled state.
The MAC addresses of Hyper-V VMs (00-15-5D) and VMWare VMs (00-05-69) are used as a condition in the policy.
