# New-FsrmFileGroup

## SYNOPSIS
Creates a file group.

## SYNTAX

```
New-FsrmFileGroup [-Name] <String> [-AsJob] [-CimSession <CimSession[]>] [-Description <String>]
 [-ExcludePattern <String[]>] [-IncludePattern <String[]>] [-ThrottleLimit <Int32>] [-Confirm] [-WhatIf]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **New-FsrmFileGroup** cmdlet creates a file group object on the server.
A file group is a logical collection of file name patterns that the server uses to define file screens and file screen exceptions.
You can also use file group definitions for generating storage report jobs based on file type.

The file group consists of two collections of wildcard patterns for file names.
One collection indicates file names that the server includes for file screens, and the other collection indicates file names that the server does not include for file screens.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Create a file group
```
PS C:\>New-FsrmFileGroup -Name "Non-HTML text files" -IncludePattern @("*.txt", "*ml") -ExcludePattern "*.html"
```

This command creates a file group named "Non-HTML text files".
The command indicates that files that end in txt or ml are included in the file group, and that files that end in .html are not included in the file group.
