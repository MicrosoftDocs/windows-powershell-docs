description: |-
  The **Start-FsrmStorageReport** cmdlet starts generating one or more storage reports on demand.
  You cannot use this cmdlet to start interactive storage reports or storage reports that do not have a schedule.

  You can view the reports immediately after the server generates them or e-mail the reports to a group of administrators.
  If you choose to open the reports immediately, you must wait while the reports are generated.
  Processing time varies, depending on the types of reports and the scope of the data.
