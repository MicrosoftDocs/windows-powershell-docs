# Stop-FsrmClassification

## SYNOPSIS
Stops the running instance of a classification.

## SYNTAX

```
Stop-FsrmClassification [-AsJob] [-CimSession <CimSession[]>] [-ThrottleLimit <Int32>] [-Confirm] [-WhatIf]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Stop-FsrmClassification** cmdlet stops the running instance of a classification job on the server.
If the cmdlet cannot stop the running or queued classification on the server, the cmdlet fails and returns an error.

This cmdlet returns a status of success in the following conditions: 
- The classification is not currently running on the server. 
- The classification is currently running and the server has started the process of cancelling the classification. 
- The classification is queued on the server and the server has successfully removed the classification from the queue.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Stop the running classification
```
PS C:\>Stop-FsrmClassification
