- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Boot
  description: |+
    Causes a computer restart after the Group Policy settings are applied.
    This is required for those Group Policy client side extensions (CSEs) that do not process Group Policy on a background update cycle, but do process Group Policy at computer startup, for example, per-computer Software Installation policy settings.

    This parameter has no effect if there are no CSEs called that require a restart.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Computer
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the computer for which to schedule a Group Policy refresh.
    You can specify the computer name in one of the following formats:

    - Full computer name (FQDN computer name); for example, computer-01.sales.contoso.com.

    - Fully qualified domain name (FQDN)\computer name; for example, sales.contoso.com\computer-01.

    - NetBIOS domain name\computer name; for example, sales\computer-01.

    - Computer name (host name): for example, computer-01.

    If the computer name is not specified the computer, on which the Invoke-GPUpdate cmdlet was run, will have the Group Policy settings refreshed.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force

    Reapplies all policy settings.
    By default, Group Policy is only refreshed when policy settings have changed.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: LogOff
  description: |+
    Causes a logoff after the policy settings have been updated.
    This is required for those Group Policy client-side extensions (CSEs) that do not process Group Policy on a background update cycle but do process Group Policy when a user logs on.
    Examples include per-user Software Installation policy settings and the Folder Redirection extension.

    This parameter has no effect if there are no CSEs called that require a logoff.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RandomDelayInMinutes
  description: |+
    Specifies the delay, in minutes that Task Scheduler will wait, with a random factor added to lower the network load, before running a scheduled Group Policy refresh.

    You can specify a delay in from 0 minutes to a maximum of 44640 minutes (31 days): 

    - A value of 0 will cause the Group Policy refresh to run as soon as the gpupdate task has been scheduled.

    -A value in the range of 1 to the maximum value of 44640 minutes cause the Group Policy refresh to delay the specified number of minutes plus a random offset before starting the Group Policy refresh.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "2"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Sync
  description: |+
    Causes the next foreground Group Policy application to be done synchronously.
    Foreground Group Policy applications occur at computer startup and user logon.
    You can specify this for the user, computer or both using the Target parameter.

    On a client computer, by default, Group Policy processes synchronously at computer startup and asynchronously at user logon.

    On a server, by default Group Policy processes synchronously at computer startup and at user logon.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Target
  description: |+
    Specifies that only user or computer policy settings are refreshed.
    By default, both user and computer policy settings are refreshed.
    You can specify one of two allowable values for this parameter:

    - User

    - Computer

    If the target parameter is not specified both user and computer policy settings will be refreshed.

  defaultValue: None

uid: GroupPolicy.Invoke-GPUpdate
name: Invoke-GPUpdate
description: |-
  The Invoke-GPUpdate cmdlet refreshes Group Policy settings, including security settings that are set on remote computers by scheduling the running of the Gpupdate command on a remote computer.
  You can combine this cmdlet in a scripted fashion to schedule the Gpupdate command on a group of computers.

  The refresh can be scheduled to immediately start a refresh of policy settings or wait for a specified period of time, up to a maximum of 31 days.
  To avoid putting a load on the network, the refresh times will be offset by a random delay.
