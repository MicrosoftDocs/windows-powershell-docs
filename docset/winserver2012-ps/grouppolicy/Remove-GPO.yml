### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Deletes a GPO.
module: GroupPolicy
notes: |-
  * When you delete a GPO, by default, all links to that GPO in the domain of the GPO are deleted. To delete a link to a GPO, you must have permission to link Group Policy Objects for the organizational unit or domain. If you do not have rights to delete a link, the GPO is deleted, but the link remains. Links from other domains and sites are not deleted. The link to a deleted GPO appears in the GPMC as Not Found. To delete Not Found links, you must either have permission on the site, domain, or organizational unit containing the link, or ask someone with sufficient rights to delete it.

    -----------

    Removes the GPO that has the GUID 50cc3e45-0b14-46dd-8b4d-afa012bc331c from the contoso.com domain.
    Because the KeepLinks parameter is specified, links between the GPO and all sites, and links between the GPO and all containers in the domain are preserved.
