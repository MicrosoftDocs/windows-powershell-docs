### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Removes one or more registry-based policy settings from either Computer Configuration or User Configuration in a GPO.
module: GroupPolicy
notes: |-
  * The hive of the registry key that you specify -- HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (HKLM) or HKEY_CURRENT_USER (HKCU) indicates whether the registry-based policy setting is removed from Computer Configuration or User Configuration.

    If a value for the registry key cannot be located (the registry key is not configured) or if subkeys are present, an error occurs and a corresponding error message is displayed.

    You can use the Domain parameter to explicitly specify the domain for this cmdlet.

    If you do not explicitly specify the domain, the cmdlet uses a default domain.
  The default domain is the domain that is used to access network resources by the security context under which the current session is running.
  This domain is typically the domain of the user that is running the session.
  For example, the domain of the user who started the session by opening Windows PowerShell from the Program Files menu, or the domain of a user that is specified in a runas command.
  However, computer startup and shutdown scripts run under the context of the LocalSystem account.
  The LocalSystem account is a built-in local account, and it accesses network resources under the context of the computer account.
  Therefore, when this cmdlet is run from a startup or shutdown script, the default domain is the domain to which the computer is joined.

    Description

    -----------

    This command removes the registry-based policy setting for the registry value "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Control Panel\Desktop ScreenSaveTimeout" from the "TestGPO" GPO.
    The registry value is no longer modified when the GPO is applied on a client.
    Removing a policy setting does not delete the registry value on a client.
    To delete the registry value when the GPO is applied on a client, you must disable the policy setting by using the Set-GPRegistryValue cmdlet.

    Description

    -----------

    This command removes all the registry-based policy settings that configure (first-level) registry values under the key "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\ExampleKey" from User Configuration in the "TestGPO" GPO.
    If there are registry-based policy settings in User Configuration that configure registry values for any subkeys of this key, an error occurs and no (first-level) policy settings are removed.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Domain
  description: |+
    Specifies the domain for this cmdlet.
    You must specify the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the domain (for example: sales.contoso.com).

    For the Remove-GPRegistryValue cmdlet, the GPO from which to remove the registry-based policy setting must exist in this domain.

    If you do not specify the Domain parameter, the domain of the user that is running the current session is used.
    (If the cmdlet is being run from a computer startup or shutdown script, the domain of the computer is used.) For more information, see the Notes section in the full Help.

    If you specify a domain that is different from the domain of the user that is running the current session (or, for a startup or shutdown script, the computer), a trust must exist between that domain and the domain of the user (or the computer).

    You can also refer to the Domain parameter by its built-in alias, "domainname".
    For more information, see about_Aliases.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true

  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Guid" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Guid
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the GPO from which to remove the registry-based policy setting by its globally unique identifier (GUID).
    The GUID uniquely identifies the GPO.

    You can also refer to the Guid parameter by its built-in alias, "id".
    For more information, see about_Aliases.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Key
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies a registry key for which to remove one or more registry-based policy settings (for example: HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsNT\DNSClient\UseDomainNameDevolution).

    The key must be in one of the two following registry hives:

    - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (HKLM) for a registry-based policy setting in Computer Configuration.

    - HKEY_CURRENT_USER (HKCU) for a registry-based policy setting in User Configuration.

    The Key parameter can be specified with or without the ValueName parameter:

    - If the ValueName parameter is specified, the registry-based policy setting that configures that registry value is removed.

    - If the ValueName parameter is not specified, all registry-based policy settings that configure any of the (first-level) values of the registry key are removed.
    If there are registry-based policy settings that configure any subkeys or their values, an error occurs.

    You can also refer to the Key parameter by its built-in alias, "FullKeyPath".
    For more information, see about_Aliases.

  description: |+
    Specifies the GPO from which to remove the registry-based policy setting by its display name.

    The display name is not guaranteed to be unique in the domain.
    If another GPO with the same display name exists in the domain an error occurs.
    You can use the Guid parameter to uniquely identify a GPO.

    You can also refer to the Name parameter by its built-in alias, "displayname".
    For more information, see about_Aliases.

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Server
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the domain controller that this cmdlet contacts to complete the operation.
    You can specify either the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or the host name.
    For example:

    FQDN: DomainController1.sales.contoso.com

    Host Name: DomainController1

    If you do not specify the name by using the Server parameter, the PDC emulator is contacted.

    You can also refer to the Server parameter by its built-in alias, "dc".
    For more information, see about_Aliases.

  position: "5"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""

  name: ValueName
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the registry value for which to remove the registry-based policy setting (for example: UseDomainNameDevolution).
    If you specify the ValueName parameter, you must also specify the Key parameter.

  defaultValue: None

name: Remove-GPRegistryValue
description: |-
  The Remove-GPRegistryValue cmdlet removes one or more registry-based policy settings from either Computer Configuration or User Configuration in a GPO.
  You can specify the GPO by its display name or by its GUID.

  You can specify either a key or a value:

  - If you specify a key, registry-based policy settings that configure any of its (first-level) values are removed.
  However, if there are registry-based policy settings that configure any subkeys or their values, an error occurs and no policy settings are removed (including those for first-level values of the key).
  For a key, specify the Key parameter without the ValueName parameter.

  - If you specify a value, the registry-based policy setting that configures that registry value is removed.
  For a value, specify the Key parameter without the ValueName parameter.

  This cmdlet can take input from the pipeline:

  - You can pipe GPO objects to this cmdlet to remove a specified registry-based policy setting from one or more GPOs.

  - You can pipe PolicyRegistrySetting objects to this cmdlet to remove one or more registry-based policy settings from a specified GPO.
