uid: Hyper-V.Remove-VMReplication
name: Remove-VMReplication
description: |-
  The **Remove-VMReplication** removes the replication relationship of a virtual machine.
  Replication must be removed independently from both the primary and Replica virtual machines.
  Removing replication on a Replica virtual machine does not delete the Replica virtual machine.
