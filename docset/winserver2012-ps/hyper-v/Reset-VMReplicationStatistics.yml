description: |-
  The **Reset-VMReplicationStatistics** cmdlet resets the replication statistics of a virtual machine.
  Statistics accumulated up to that time are deleted, and replication monitoring begins collecting a new set of statistics.
  If replication health was reported as "Warning", then this operation also changes the health to "Normal".
