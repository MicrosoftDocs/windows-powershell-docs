examples:
- title: Example 1
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Set-VHD -Path Child1.vhd -ParentPath ParentCopy.vhd -LeafPath Child2.vhd
  description: |-
    This example sets the parent of the virtual hard disk associated with ParentCopy.vhd as the parent of the chained virtual hard disk associated with Child1.vhd, where the leaf of the virtual disk chain is the virtual hard disk associated with Child2.vhd.
    The operation is performed in online mode.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 2
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Set-VHD -Path Child1.vhd -ParentPath ParentCopy.vhd
  description: |-
    This example sets the parent of the virtual hard disk associated with ParentCopy.vhd as the parent of the chained virtual hard disk associated with Child1.vhd.
    This operation cannot be performed when the virtual disk chain is attached.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 3
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Set-VHD -Path Child1.vhd -parentpath parentcopywithnewid.vhd -IgnoreMismatchId
  description: |-
    This example sets the parent of Child1.vhd to point to parentcopywithnewid.vhd, even though parentcopywithnewid.vhd has a different ID than the original parent of child1.vhd.
    The operation is performed in offline mode.
    This mode should be used with extreme caution, and only when it is certain that the block contents of the new and old parents are exactly the same.
    Otherwise data loss can occur.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 4
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Set-VHD -Path c:\test.vhdx -PhysicalSectorSizeBytes 512
  description: |-
    This example sets the physical sector size of a VHDX to 512 bytes.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: ComputerName
  description: |+
    Specifies one or more Hyper-V hosts on which the parent of a virtual hard disk in a differencing hard disk chain is to be set.
    NetBIOS names, IP addresses, and fully-qualified domain names are allowable.
    The default is the local computer - use "localhost" or a dot (".") to specify the local computer explicitly.

  defaultValue: .
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IgnoreIdMismatch
  description: |+
    Specifies that the check for identifier mismatch between the parent and child virtual hard disk is to be skipped.

  defaultValue: "FALSE"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: LeafPath
  description: |+
    Specifies the path to the virtual hard disk file of the virtual hard disk representing the leaf node of the virtual hard disk chain.
    Required when performing the operation in online mode.

  defaultValue: None
  acceptWildcardCharacters: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ParentPath
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the path to the parent disk of a differencing virtual hard disk.
    Can be performed regardless of whether the disk is online or offline.

  defaultValue: None
  acceptWildcardCharacters: true
  position: "2"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Passthru
  description: |+
    Specifies that an object is to be passed through to the pipeline representing the virtual hard disk whose parent is to be set.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Path
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the path to the virtual hard disk file of the virtual hard disk drive whose parent in the virtual hard disk chain is to be set.

  defaultValue: None
  acceptWildcardCharacters: true
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PhysicalSectorSizeBytes
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the physical sector size, in bytes.
    Valid values are 512 and 4096.
    This parameter is supported only on a VHDX-format disk that is not attached when the operation is initiated.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: Hyper-V.Set-VHD
name: Set-VHD
description: |-
  The **Set-VHD** cmdlet sets the ParentPath or PhysicalSectorSizeBytes properties of a virtual hard disk.
  The two properties must be set in separate operations.
