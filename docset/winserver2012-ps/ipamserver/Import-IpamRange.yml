description: |-
  The **Import-IpamRange** cmdlet imports IP address range objects from the specified comma-separated values (.csv) file into the computer running the IP Address Management (IPAM) server.
  The computer running the IPAM server does not support import of IP address ranges that have the **ServiceInstance** parameter value of `MS DHCP`, since this is reserved for DHCP scopes automatically discovered by the computer running the IPAM server from the managed computers running Microsoft DHCP server services.
  Any objects that fail being imported during the operation are logged in the appropriate error log file for further analysis.

  This cmdlet supports two parameter sets.
  The default invocation of the cmdlet adds new IP address range objects from the .csv file into the computer running the IPAM server and edits the existing address ranges with updated information specified in the .csv file.

  The second parameter set can be used to periodically import and update all IP address range objects that belong to the specified unique combination of the **ManagedByService** and **ServiceInstance** parameters, in the computer running the IPAM server.
  Along with adding new ranges and editing existing ranges, this import operation also deletes those ranges from the computer running the IPAM server which have the same value as the **ManagedByService** and **ServiceInstance** parameters but are not present in the .csv file being imported.
  This parameter set further provides the option of deleting the IP addresses mapping to the IP address ranges that are deleted during import by using the **DeleteMappedAddresses** parameter.

  The import and update of IP address ranges for the specified **ManagedByService** and **ServiceInstance** parameter values succeeds if these values are present in the computer running the IPAM server at the time of import.
  The **AddManagedByService** and **AddServiceInstance** can be used to create the specified **ManagedByService** and **ServiceInstance** parameter values within the computer running the IPAM server at run-time before the import operation, if required.

  The only mandatory field required to be present in the .csv file being imported for IPAM ranges is the network identifier (ID) itself.
  Any other range specific basic field or custom field can be specified in any order in the .csv file for import.
  Sample format of import .csv file, can be generated using IPAM export functionality from IPAM UI (localized format) or IPAM Windows PowerShell® (English format).

  Note: The IPAM Windows PowerShell import supports both English as well as server localized .csv file.
  The computer running the IPAM server uses presence of the field named `NetworkId` (without spaces) in the .csv file to ascertain that the file must be processed in English format.
  Otherwise the file is processed in the server localized format for the various field names and enumeration values.
  The format of date and time values of the imported objects are always interpreted in the localized format of the computer running the IPAM server and not in UTC.
