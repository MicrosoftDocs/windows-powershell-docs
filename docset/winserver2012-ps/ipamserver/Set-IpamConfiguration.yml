  name: Port
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the TCP port number being configured for communication between computers running the IPAM RSAT client and IPAM server.
    The required firewall rules are also set up for this port.
    Although IPAM allows any port number from `1` through `65535` to be configured for communication between computers running the IPAM client and server; it is recommended, to avoid port conflicts with well-known ports, that a port from the unassigned port range `48620` through `49150` is selected.

description: |-
  The **Set-IpamConfiguration** cmdlet sets the IP Address Management (IPAM) server configuration, including the TCP port over which the computer running the IPAM Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT) client connects and communicates with the computer running the IPAM server.
  This cmdlet can be leveraged to specify an alternate firewall port number for remotely managing the computer running the IPAM server, in the event of a port conflict.
  The default port number used by IPAM is `48885`.
  The cmdlet configures appropriate custom IPAM server firewall rules for the specified new port, enables appropriate custom IPAM server firewall rules for the specified new port, and restarts the IPAM application pool to listen on the specified new port.
  This cmdlet must be run from an elevated Windows PowerShellÂ® prompt with administrator privileges on the computer running the IPAM server.
