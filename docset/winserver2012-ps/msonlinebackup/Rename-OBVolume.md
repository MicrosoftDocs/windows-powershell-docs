# Rename-OBVolume

## SYNOPSIS
Maps a backed up volume to its new name after the operating system has been reinstalled on the backed up server.

## SYNTAX

```
Rename-OBVolume [-OldVolumeName] <String> [-NewVolumeName] <String>
```

## DESCRIPTION
The Rename-OBVolume cmdlet maps a backed up volume to its new name after the operating system has been reinstalled on the backed up server.
. This cmdlet is useful in the scenario where the operating system is reinstalled and as a result the volume GUID of a backed up volume is changed.
After this cmdlet has been run the backup policy of OldVolumeName would be applied to NewVolumeName.

Note: OldVolumeName and NewVolumeName can be same if the volume GUID has changed but the volume name has not changed.
