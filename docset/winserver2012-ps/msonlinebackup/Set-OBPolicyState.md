# Set-OBPolicyState

## SYNOPSIS
Sets the PolicyState of the current backup policy object.
The state can be either Valid or Paused.

## SYNTAX

```
Set-OBPolicyState [-Policy] <CBPolicy> [-State] <OMPolicyStates> [-Confirm] [-WhatIf]
```

## DESCRIPTION
This cmdlet can be used to set the current state of the backup policy.
The state can be either Valid or Paused.

A Valid state means that the backups will happen based on the defined schedule and that backups will be retained based on the retention policy.

A Paused state means that backups will not occur according to the defined schedule that the current backups will be retained until the backup policy is changed to Valid state or is deleted.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
PS C:\> $P = Get-OBPolicy
PS C:\> Set-OBPolicyState   $P "Valid"
PS C:\> Set-OBPolicy   $P
```

This example sets the OBPolicyState to Valid and updates the OBPolicy object.

### EXAMPLE 2
```
PS C:\> $P = Get-OBPolicy
PS C:\> Set-OBPolicyState   $P "Paused"
PS C:\> Set-OBPolicy   $P
```

This example sets the OBPolicyState to Paused and updates the OBPolicy object.

### EXAMPLE 3
```
PS C:\> Get-OBPolicy | Set-OBPolicyState -State "Paused" | Set-OBPolicy
```

This example sets the OBPolicyState to Paused and updates the OBPolicy object using pipelines.
