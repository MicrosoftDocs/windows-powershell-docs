  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a New-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967 or Get-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966 cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IncludeHidden
  description: |+
    Specifies both visible and hidden network adapters should be included.
    By default only visible network adapters are included.
    If a wildcard character is used in identifying a network adapter and this parameter has been specified, then the wildcard string is matched against both hidden and visible network adapters.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: InterfaceDescription
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the network adapter interface description.
    For a physical network adapter this is typically the vendors name of the network adapter followed by a part number and description, such as `Contoso 12345 Gigabit Network Device`.

  defaultValue: None
  acceptWildcardCharacters: true
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ifDesc
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Name
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the network adapter.

  defaultValue: None
  acceptWildcardCharacters: true
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ifAlias, InterfaceAlias
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None

description: |-
  The **Get-NetAdapterLso** cmdlet gets the state of large send offload (LSO) settings on the network adapter.
  LSO is a technology where the work of segmenting data into network frames is performed by the network adapter instead of by the TCP/IP stack.
  With LSO, TCP/IP sends very large data packets down to the network adapter driver and the network adapter hardware.
  The network adapter breaks up the data into smaller network-sized frames.
  This increases the speed of high-end send operations and decreases the processor usage of the computer, because the work is performed on the network adapter.
