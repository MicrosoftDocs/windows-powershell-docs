  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />

  name: NoRestart
  description: |+
    Specifies that the network adapter is not restarted as part of running this cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt16" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: NumaNode
  description: |+
    Sets the NUMA node affinity for a network adapter.
    This will ensure that a given network transmission is load balanced by RSS within the NUMA node.
    This affects the memory allocation and also impacts the preference and ordering of the processors in the processor array.
    It does not affect the set of processors contained in the array, but it may impact the subset of the array that RSS actually uses.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: NumberOfReceiveQueues

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PassThru
  description: |+
    Returns an object representing the item with which you are working.
    By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Profile" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Profile
  description: |+
    Specifies the RSS profile.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are: Closest, ClosestStatic, NUMA, NUMAStatic, or Conservative. 

     - Closest: Behavior is consistent with the behavior of firstref_server_7. 

     - ClosestStatic: No dynamic load balancing, such as distributing but not load balancing at runtime. 

     - NUMA: Assigns RSS processors in a round robin basis across every NUMA node to enable applications that are running on NUMA servers to scale well. 

     - NUMAStatic: Default behavior.
    RSS processor selection is the same as for NUMA scalability without dynamic load balancing. 

     - Conservative: RSS uses as few processors as possible to sustain the load.
    This option helps reduce the number of interrupts.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"

uid: NetAdapter.Set-NetAdapterRss
name: Set-NetAdapterRss
description: |-
  The **Set-NetAdapterRss** cmdlet sets the receive side scaling (RSS) properties on the network adapter.
  RSS is a scalability technology that distributes the receive network traffic among multiple processors by hashing the header of the incoming packet.
  Without RSS in firstref_longhorn, firstref_server_7, and Windows Server® 2012; network traffic is received on the first processor which can quickly reach full utilization limiting receive network throughput.
  Many properties can be configured using the parameters to optimize the performance of RSS.
  The selection of the processors to use for RSS is an important aspect of load balancing.
  Most of the parameters for this cmdlet help to determine the processors used by RSS.
  A thorough understanding of RSS is recommended before modifying individual parameters.
  Selecting the correct profile should be sufficient in most scenarios.
