- type: <xref href="UInt16" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BaseProcessorGroup
  description: |+
    Specifies the processor group to be used by VMQ.
    Support for systems that have more than `64` logical processors is based on the concept of a processor group, which is a static set of up to `64` logical processors.
    Processor groups are numbered starting with `0`.
    Computers with fewer than `64` logical processors always have a single group, Group `0`.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Byte" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BaseProcessorNumber
  description: |+
    Specifies the starting processor to be used within the processor group for VMQ.
    Support for systems that have more than `64` logical processors is based on the concept of a processor group, which is a static set of up to `64` logical processors.
    Processor groups are numbered starting with `0`.
    Computers with fewer than `64` logical processors always have a single group, Group `0`.
    A logical processor is identified by a group number, using the **BaseProcessorGroup** parameter, and a group-relative processor number, using this parameter.

    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Enabled
  description: |+
    Sets the enabled state of VMQ.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are: `$true` or `$false`.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IncludeHidden
  description: |+
    Specifies both visible and hidden network adapters should be included.
    By default only visible network adapters are included.
    If a wildcard character is used in identifying a network adapter and this parameter has been specified, then the wildcard string is matched against both hidden and visible network adapters.

  defaultValue: None

  name: InputObject
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the input to this cmdlet.
    You can use this parameter, or you can pipe the input to this cmdlet.

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: InterfaceDescription
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the network adapter interface description.
    For a physical network adapter this is typically the name of the vendor of the network adapter followed by a part number and description, such as `Contoso 12345 Gigabit Network Device`.

  defaultValue: None

  name: NoRestart
  description: |+
    Specifies that the network adapter is not restarted as part of running this cmdlet.

  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

uid: NetAdapter.Set-NetAdapterVmq
name: Set-NetAdapterVmq
description: |-
  The **Set-NetAdapterVmq** cmdlet sets the virtual machine queue (VMQ) properties of the network adapter.
  VMQ is a scaling networking technology for Hyper-V switch that improves network throughput by distributing processing of network traffic for multiple virtual machines (VMs) among multiple processors.
  A thorough familiarity with VMQ and dynamic VMQ is highly recommended before changing any default values with this cmdlet.
