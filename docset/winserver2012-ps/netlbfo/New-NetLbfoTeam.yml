- title: 'Example 2: Create a new team with specified properties'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>New-NetLbfoTeam -Name Team1 -TeamMembers NIC1,NIC2 -TeamingMode LACP
    -LoadBalancingAlgorithm HyperVPort
  description: |-
    This command creates a new team named Team1 that consists of two team members named NIC1 and NIC2.
    The teaming mode is set to LACP and the load balancing algorithm is set to HyperVPorts.

- title: 'Example 3: Create a new team in a virtual machine'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Set-VMNetworkAdapter -VMName <VMname> -AllowTeaming




    PS C:\>New-NetLbfoTeam -Name Team2 -TeamMembers NIC1,NIC2
  description: |-
    This set of commands allows teaming in virtual machines by using the **AllowTeaming** parameter of the Set-VMNetworkAdapter cmdlet and then creates a team named Team2 in the virtual machine specified by **VMName**.
    You must run the following command in the host (parent partition) with administrator permissions.

  name: AsJob

    ps_cimcommon_asjob

  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a New-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967 or Get-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966 cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None

  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="LBAlgos" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: LoadBalancingAlgorithm
  description: |+
    Specifies the load-balancing algorithm the new team uses to distribute network traffic between the interfaces.

    You can specify one of the following four load balancing algorithms:

    **TransportPorts**: Uses the source and destination TCP ports and the IP addresses to create a hash and then assigns the packets that have the matching hash value to one of the available interfaces.

    **IPAddresses**: Uses the source and destination IP addresses to create a hash and then assigns the packets that have the matching hash value to one of the available interfaces.

    **MacAddresses**: Uses the source and destination MAC addresses to create a hash and then assigns the packets that have the matching hash value to one of the available interfaces.

    **HyperVPort**: Distributes network traffic based on the source virtual machine Hyper-V switch port identifier.

  defaultValue: TransportPorts
  position: "6"
  aliases: lba
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the new NIC team.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="TeamingModes" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: TeamingMode
  description: |+
    Specifies the mode of the NIC teaming.
    You can specify one of the following three teaming modes:

    **LACP**: Uses the IEEE 802.1ax Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) to dynamically identify links that are connected between the host and a given switch.
    (This protocol was formerly known as IEEE 802.3ad draft)

    **Static**: Requires configuration on both the switch and the host to identify which links form the team.

    **SwitchIndependent**: Specifies that a network switch configuration is not needed for the NIC team.
    Because the network switch is not configured to know about the interface teaming, the team interfaces can be connected to different switches.

  defaultValue: SwitchIndependent
  position: "5"
  aliases: tm
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="WildcardPattern" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: TeamMembers
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the names of the network adapters that are members of the new team.
    Specify multiple network adapter names (or wildcard patterns) separated by a comma.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "2"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: TeamNicName
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the new team interface.
    This is the name used to reference the teamed network adapters.

  defaultValue: Same as team name
  position: "4"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: NetLbfo.New-NetLbfoTeam
name: New-NetLbfoTeam
description: |-
  The **New-NetLbfoTeam** cmdlet creates a new NIC team that consists of one or more network adapters.
  Teaming network adapters of different speeds is not supported.
  You can create a team with network adapters of different speeds, but the network traffic distribution algorithms do not take the speed of each network adapter into consideration when distributing traffic.

  When you create a team, you can specify additional properties such as **TeamingMode** and **LoadBalancingAlgorithm**.

  You need administrator privileges to use **New-NetLbfoTeam**.
