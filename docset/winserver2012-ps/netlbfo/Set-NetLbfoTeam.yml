  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a New-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967 or Get-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966 cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  name: InputObject
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the object which contains the NIC team parameters to set.

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="LBAlgos" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: LoadBalancingAlgorithm
  description: |+
    Specifies the load balancing algorithm the NIC team uses to distribute network traffic between the interfaces.

    You can specify one of the following four load balancing algorithms:

    **TransportPorts**: Uses the source and destination TCP ports and the IP addresses to create a hash, and then assigns the packets that have the matching hash value to one of the available interfaces.

    **IPAddresses**: Uses the source and destination IP addresses to create a hash, and then assigns the packets that have the matching hash value to one of the available interfaces.

    **MacAddresses**: Uses the source and destination MAC addresses to create a hash and then assigns the packets that have the matching hash value to one of the available interfaces.

    **HyperVPort**: Distributes network traffic based on the source virtual machine Hyper-V switch port identifier.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: lba
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimInstance" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MemberOfTheTeam
  description: |+
    Specifies the network adapter name for which to modify the parameters.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Name
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the NIC team to modify.

  defaultValue: None
  acceptWildcardCharacters: true

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PassThru
  description: |+
    Returns an object representing the item with which you are working.
    By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="TeamingModes" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: TeamingMode
  description: |+
    Specifies the mode of the NIC teaming.
    You can specify one of the following three teaming modes:

    **LACP**: Requires configuration on both the switch and the host to identify which links form the team.
    Uses the Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) to identify links that are connected between the host and a given switch.

    **Static**: Requires configuration on both the switch and the host to identify which links form the team.

    **SwitchIndependent**: Specifies that a network switch configuration is not needed for the NIC team.
    Because the network switch is not configured to know about the NIC teaming, the team members can be connected to different switches.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: tm
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimInstance" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: TeamNicForTheTeam
  description: |+
    Specifies the team interface whose associated NIC team is to be modified.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None

uid: NetLbfo.Set-NetLbfoTeam
name: Set-NetLbfoTeam
description: |-
  The **Set-NetLbfoTeam** cmdlet sets the **TeamingMode** or **LoadBalancingAlgorithm** parameters  on the specified NIC team.

  You need administrator privileges to use **Set-NetLbfoTeam**.
