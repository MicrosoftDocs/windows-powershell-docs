  name: AdministrativeMode
  description: |+
    Specifies the administrative mode of the network adapter to modify.

    You can specify one of the following two administrative modes:

    **Active**: Allows the team member to participate in the NIC team.
    By default, the role of the team member is Active.

    **Standby**: Places the member in a standby state where it does not participate in the team.
    The team member will be automatically moved to Active state if any other member of the team fails.

    At most one member in a team can be in Standby mode.
