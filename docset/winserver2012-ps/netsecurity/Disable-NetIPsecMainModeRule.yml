  description: |+
    Specifies that matching main mode rules of the indicated description are disabled.

  name: DisplayGroup
  description: |+
    Specifies that only matching main mode rules of the indicated group association are disabled.
    Wildcard characters are accepted. 

    The **Group** parameter specifies the source string for this parameter.
    If the value for this parameter is a localizable string, then the **Group** parameter contains an indirect string.
    Rule groups can be used to organize rules by influence and allows batch rule modifications.
    Using the Set-NetIPsecMainModeRule cmdlet, if the group name is specified for a set of rules or sets, then all of the rules or sets in that group receive the same set of modifications.
    It is good practice to specify the **Group** parameter value with a universal and world-ready indirect @FirewallAPI name. 
    Note: This parameter cannot be specified upon object creation using the New-NetIPsecMainModeRule cmdlet, but can be modified using dot-notation and the Set-NetIPsecMainModeRule cmdlet.

  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies that only matching main mode rules of the indicated display name are disabled.
    Wildcard characters are accepted. 

    Specifies the localized, user-facing name of the firewall rule being created.
    When creating a rule this parameter is required.
    This parameter value is locale-dependent.
    If the object is not modified, this parameter value may change in certain circumstances.
    When writing scripts in multi-lingual environments, the **Name** parameter should be used instead, where the default value is a randomly assigned value. 
    Note: This parameter cannot be set to All.

  name: Enabled
  description: |+
    Specifies that matching main mode rules of the indicated state are disabled. 

    This parameter specifies that the rule object is administratively enabled or administratively disabled.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

     -- True: Specifies the rule is currently enabled. 

     -- False: Specifies the rule is currently disabled.
    A disabled rule will not actively modify computer behavior, but the management construct still exists on the computer so it can be re-enabled.

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: GPOSession
  description: |+
    Specifies the network GPO from which to retrieve the rules to be disabled. 

    This parameter is used in the same way as the **PolicyStore** parameter.
    When modifying GPOs in Windows PowerShell®, each change to a GPO requires the entire GPO to be loaded, modified, and saved back.
    On a busy Domain Controller (DC), this can be a slow and resource-heavy operation.
    A GPO Session loads a domain GPO onto the local computer and makes all changes in a batch, before saving it back.
    This reduces the load on the DC and speeds up the Windows PowerShell cmdlets.
    To load a GPO Session, use the Open-NetGPO cmdlet.
    To save a GPO Session, use the Save-NetGPO cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None

  name: Group
  description: |+
    Specifies that only matching main mode rules of the indicated group association are disabled.
    Wildcard characters are accepted. 

    This parameter specifies the source string for the **DisplayGroup** parameter.
    If the **DisplayGroup** parameter value is a localizable string, then this parameter contains an indirect string.
    Rule groups can be used to organize rules by influence and allows batch rule modifications.
    Using the Set-NetIPsecMainModeRule cmdlets, if the group name is specified for a set of rules or sets, then all of the rules or sets in that group receive the same set of modifications.
    It is a good practice to specify this parameter value with a universal and world-ready indirect @FirewallAPI name. 
    Note: The **DisplayGroup** parameter cannot be specified upon object creation using the New-NetIPsecMainModeRule cmdlet, but can be modified using dot-notation and the Set-NetIPsecMainModeRule cmdlet.

  name: MainModeCryptoSet
  description: |+
    Specifies the main mode rules that are associated with the given main mode cryptographic set to be disabled. 

    Specifies, by Name, the main mode cryptographic set to be associated with the main mode rule. 

    A NetIPsecMainModeCryptoSet object represents a main mode cryptographic conditions associated with a main mode rule.
    This parameter sets the methods for main mode negotiation by describing the proposals for encryption.
    This is only associated with main mode rules.
    See the Get-NetIPsecMainModeCryptoSet cmdlet for more information.
    Alternatively, the **AssociatedNetIPsecMainModeCryptoSet** parameter can be used for the same purpose, but is used to pipe the input set into the rule. 
    Note: When specifying cryptographic sets, the **Name** parameter value of the cryptographic set must be used.
    The object cannot be directly passed into the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies that only matching main mode rules of the indicated name are disabled.
    Wildcard characters are accepted. 

    This parameter acts just like a file name, in that only one rule with a given name may exist in a policy store at a time.
    During group policy processing and policy merge, rules that have the same name but come from multiple stores being merged, will overwrite one another so that only one exists.
    This overwriting behavior is desirable if the rules serve the same purpose.
    For instance, all of the firewall rules have specific names, so if an administrator can copy these rules to a GPO, and the rules will override the local versions on a local computer.
    GPOs can have precedence.
    So if an administrator has a different or more specific rule with the same name in a higher-precedence GPO, then it overrides other rules that exist. 

    The default value is a randomly assigned value. 

    When the defaults for main mode encryption need to overridden, specify the customized parameters and set this parameter, making this parameter the new default setting for encryption.

  name: Phase1AuthSet
  description: |+
    Specifies the main mode rules that are associated with the given phase 1 authentication set to be disabled. 

    This parameter specifies, by Name, the Phase 1 authentication set to be associated with the main mode rule. 

    A NetIPsecPhase1AuthSet object represents the phase 1 authentication conditions associated with an IPsec or main mode rule.
    This parameter sets the methods for main mode negotiation by describing the proposals for computer authentication.
    See the New-NetIPsecAuthProposal cmdlet of more information.
    Alternatively, the **AssociatedNetIPsecPhase1AuthSet** parameter can be used for the same purpose, but is used to pipe the input set into the rule.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PolicyStore
  description: |+
    Specifies the policy store from which to retrieve the rules to be disabled. 

    A policy store is a container for firewall and IPsec policy. 
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

     -- PersistentStore: Sometimes called static rules, this store contains the persistent policy for the local computer.
    This policy is not from GPOs, and has been created manually or programmatically (during application installation) on the computer.
    Rules created in this store are attached to the ActiveStore and activated on the computer immediately. 

     -- ActiveStore: This store contains the currently active policy, which is the sum of all policy stores that apply to the computer.
    This is the resultant set of policy (RSOP) for the local computer (the sum of all GPOs that apply to the computer), and the local stores (the PersistentStore, the static Windows service hardening (WSH), and the configurable WSH).

     ---- GPOs are also policy stores.
    Computer GPOs can be specified as follows. 

     ------ `-PolicyStore hostname`. 

     ---- Active Directory GPOs can be specified as follows. 

     ------ `-PolicyStore domain.fqdn.com\GPO_Friendly_Namedomain.fqdn.comGPO_Friendly_Name`. 

     ------ Such as the following. 

     -------- `-PolicyStore localhost`

     -------- `-PolicyStore corp.contoso.com\FirewallPolicy`

     ---- Active Directory GPOs can be created using the New-GPO cmdlet or the Group Policy Management Console.


     -- RSOP: This read-only store contains the sum of all GPOs applied to the local computer. 

     -- SystemDefaults: This read-only store contains the default state of firewall rules that ship with Windows Server® 2012. 

     -- StaticServiceStore: This read-only store contains all the service restrictions that ship with Windows.
    Optional and product-dependent features are considered part of Windows Server 2012 for the purposes of WFAS. 

     -- ConfigurableServiceStore: This read-write store contains all the service restrictions that are added for third-party services.
    In addition, network isolation rules that are created for Windows Store application containers will appear in this policy store. 

    The default value is PersistentStore. 
    Note: The Set-NetIPsecMainModeRule cmdlet cannot be used to add an object to a policy store.
    An object can only be added to a policy store at creation time with the Copy-NetIPsecMainModeRule cmdlet or with the New-NetIPsecMainModeRule cmdlet.

  name: PolicyStoreSource
  description: |+
    Specifies that main mode rules that match the indicated policy store source are disabled. 

    This parameter contains a path to the policy store where the rule originated if the object is retrieved from the ActiveStore with the TracePolicyStoreSource option set.
    This parameter value is automatically generated and should not be modified. 

    The monitoring output from this parameter is not completely compatible with the **PolicyStore** parameter.
    This parameter value cannot always be passed into the **PolicyStore** parameter.
    Domain GPOs are one example in which this parameter contains only the GPO name, not the domain name.

    Specifies the type of policy store where the rule originated if the object is retrieved from the ActiveStore with the TracePolicyStoreSource option set.
    This parameter value is automatically generated and should not be modified. 
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

     -- Local: The object originates from the local store. 

     -- GroupPolicy: The object originates from a GPO. 

     -- Dynamic: The object originates from the local runtime state.
    This policy store name is not valid for use in the cmdlets, but may appear when monitoring active policy. 

     -- Generated: The object was generated automatically.
    This policy store name is not valid for use in the cmdlets, but may appear when monitoring active policy. 

     -- Hardcoded: The object was hard-coded.
    This policy store name is not valid for use in the cmdlets, but may appear when monitoring active policy.

uid: NetSecurity.Disable-NetIPsecMainModeRule
name: Disable-NetIPsecMainModeRule
description: |-
  The **Disable-NetIPsecMainModeRule** cmdlet disables a previously enabled main mode rule to be inactive within the computer or a Group Policy organizational unit.
  A disabled rule will no actively modify computer behavior, but the rule still exists on the computer or in a Group Policy Object (GPO) so it can be re-enabled.
  This is different from the Remove-NetIPsecMainModeRule cmdlet, which permanently removes the construct from the computer.

  This cmdlet gets one or more main mode rules to be disabled with the **Name** parameter (default), the **DisplayName** parameter, rule properties, or by associated filters or objects.
  The **Enabled** parameter value for the resulting queried rules is set to False.

  Disabling firewall and IPsec rules can be useful for debugging IPsec policy mismatch issues, but it is easier when the rules are in the local, or persistent, store.
  Disabling rules in a GPO container will not take effect until the next time the client applies the GPO.
  To troubleshoot GPO-based IPsec policy, consider copying all the rules, and authorization and cryptographic sets from the GPO to a computer that does not have the GPO applied using the corresponding Copy-NetIPsecMainModeRule cmdlet.
  This is the way to locally modify the policy, in order to troubleshoot any IPsec problems.
