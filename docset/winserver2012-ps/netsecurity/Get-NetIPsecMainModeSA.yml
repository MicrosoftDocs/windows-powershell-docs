    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a New-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967 or Get-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966 cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies that only matching main mode rules of the indicated name are retrieved.
    Wildcard characters are accepted. 

    This parameter acts just like a file name, in that only one rule with a given name may exist in a policy store at a time.
    During group policy processing and policy merge, rules that have the same name but come from multiple stores being merged, will overwrite one another so that only one exists.
    This overwriting behavior is desirable if the rules serve the same purpose.
    For instance, all of the firewall rules have specific names, so if an administrator can copy these rules to a GPO, and the rules will override the local versions on a local computer.
    Since GPOs can have precedence, if an administrator that gives a rule with a different or more specific rule the same name in a higher-precedence GPO, then it overrides other rules that exist. 

    The default value is a randomly assigned value. 

    When the defaults for main mode encryption are overridden, specify the customized parameters and set this parameter value, making this parameter the new default setting for encryption.

- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

description: |-
  The **Get-NetIPsecMainModeSA** cmdlet gets an active main mode security association (SA).
  This cmdlet is used for policy monitoring.

  An SA is generated when main mode negotiation establishes a secure, authenticated channel between two computers.
  The SA is the information maintained about that secure channel on the local computer so that it can use the information for future network traffic to the remote computer.

  An SA is the combination of a negotiated key, security protocol, and SPI, which together define the security used to protect the communication from sender to receiver.
  Therefore, by looking at the security associations for this computer, which computers have connections with this computer can be determined, which type of data integrity and encryption is being used for that connection, and other information.
  This information can be helpful when testing IPsec policies and troubleshooting access issues.

  There are four mandatory parameters that negotiated as part of the main mode SA: 

   -- The computer authentication method: Kerberos v5, certificate, or pre-shared key (PSK) authentication, provided by the NetIPsecPhase1AuthSet object. 

   -- The encryption algorithm, provided by the NetIPsecMainModeCryptoSet object. 

   -- The hashing algorithm, provided by the NetIPsecMainModeCryptoSet object. 

   -- The Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange group to be used for the base keying material, provided by theNetIPsecMainModeCryptoSet object.
