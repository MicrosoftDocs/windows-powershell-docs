## DESCRIPTION
The **Get-NetIPsecRule** cmdlet returns the instances of IPsec rules that match the search parameters from the user.
See the New-NetIPsecRule cmdlet for more information.

This cmdlet returns IPsec rules by specifying the **IPsecRuleName** parameter (default), the **DisplayName** parameter, rule properties, or by associated filters or objects.
The queried rules can be placed into variables and piped to other cmdlets for further modifications or monitoring.

When running the cmdlet with the get noun for any firewall, IPsec, or main mode rule, notice that the common conditions like addresses or ports do not appear.
These conditions are represented in separate objects called filters.
The filter-to-rule relationship is always one-to-one and is managed automatically.
If a query for rules based on the parameters (ports, addresses, security, interfaces, and services) is performed, then the filter objects with the corresponding cmdlet with the Get verb should to be retrieved.
See the Get-NetFirewallAddressFilter, Get-NetFirewallApplicationFilter, Get-NetFirewallInterfaceFilter, Get-NetFirewallInterfaceTypeFilter, Get-NetFirewallPortFilter, Get-NetFirewallProfile, Get-NetFirewallSecurityFilter, Get-NetFirewallServiceFilter, or Get-NetFirewallRule cmdlet for more information.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
PS C:\>Get-NetIPsecRule -PolicyStore ActiveStore
```

This example gets all IPsec rules currently in the active store.
Running this cmdlet without specifying the policy store retrieves the persistent store.

### EXAMPLE 2
```
PS C:\>Get-NetIPsecRule -DisplayName "SecureNet: Exempt SAP Server"
```

This example gets an IPsec rule and displays the parameters given based upon the localized rule name.

### EXAMPLE 3
```
PS C:\>Get-NetIPsecRule -DisplayGroup "DirectAccess-Traffic"
```

This example gets all the IPsec rules associated to a specified group.

### EXAMPLE 4
```
PS C:\>Get-NetFirewallInterfaceTypeFilter | Where-Object -Property { $_.InterfaceType -Eq "Wireless" } | Get-NetIPsecRule
```

This example gets all IPsec rules associated with wireless interface.

This parameter specifies parameters for the quick mode negotiation as well as dictating the cryptographic proposals that should be proposed during the exchange.
This is only associated with IPsec rules.
See the Get-NetIPsecQuickModeCryptoSet cmdlet for more information. 

Alternatively, the **QuickModeCryptoSet** parameter can be used for the same purpose, but does not allow the cryptographic set to be piped into the cmdlet and the set must be specified with the **IPsecRuleName** parameter.

```yaml
Type: CimInstance
Parameter Sets: UNNAMED_PARAMETER_SET_6
Aliases: 

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)

```

### -CimSession
Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a New-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967 or Get-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966 cmdlet.
The default is the current session on the local computer.

```yaml
Type: CimSession[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: Session

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Description
Specifies that matching IPsec rules of the indicated description are retrieved.
Wildcard characters are accepted. 

This parameter provides information about the IPsec rule.
This parameter specifies a localized, user-facing description of the object.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: UNNAMED_PARAMETER_SET_2
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DisplayGroup
Specifies that only matching firewall rules of the indicated group association are retrieved.
Wildcard characters are accepted. 

The **Group** parameter specifies the source string for this parameter.
If the value for this parameter is a localizable string, then the **Group** parameter contains an indirect string.
Rule groups can be used to organize rules by influence and allows batch rule modifications.
Using the Set-NetIPsecRule cmdlet, if the group name is specified for a set of rules or sets, then all of the rules or sets in that group receive the same set of modifications.
It is a good practice to specify the **Group** parameter value with a universal and world-ready indirect @FirewallAPI name. 
Note: This parameter cannot be specified upon object creation using the New-NetIPsecRule cmdlet, but can be modified using dot-notation and the Set-NetIPsecRule cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: UNNAMED_PARAMETER_SET_2
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DisplayName
Specifies that only matching IPsec rules of the indicated display name are retrieved.
Wildcard characters are accepted. 

Specifies the localized, user-facing name of the IPsec rule being created.
When creating a rule this parameter is required.
This parameter value is locale-dependent.
If the object is not modified, this parameter value may change in certain circumstances.
When writing scripts in multi-lingual environments, the **IPsecRuleName** parameter should be used instead, where the default value is a randomly assigned value.
Note: This parameter cannot be set to All.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: UNNAMED_PARAMETER_SET_5
Aliases: 

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Enabled
Specifies that matching IPsec rules of the indicated state are enabled. 

This parameter specifies that the rule object is administratively enabled or administratively enabled.
The acceptable values for this parameter are:

 -- True: Specifies the rule is currently enabled. 

 -- False: Specifies the rule is currently disabled.
A disabled rule will not actively modify computer behavior, but the management construct still exists on the computer so it can be re-enabled.

```yaml
Type: Enabled[]
Parameter Sets: UNNAMED_PARAMETER_SET_2
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -EncryptedTunnelBypass
Indicates that matching IPsec rules of the specified value are retrieved. 

This parameter specifies the encapsulation state for network traffic sent to a tunnel end point that is already IPsec protected.
If this parameter is set to True, then the network traffic sent to a tunnel end point that is already IPsec protected does not have to be encapsulated again.
This option can improve network performance in the case where network traffic that is already end-to-end protected by other IPsec rules. 

The default value is False. 

This parameter is only supported on firstref_server_7 and Windows Server 2012.

```yaml
Type: Boolean[]
Parameter Sets: UNNAMED_PARAMETER_SET_2
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ForwardPathLifetime
Specifies that matching IPsec rules of the specified path lifetime value are retrieved. 

This parameter specifies the session key lifetime for an IPsec rule, in minutes.
The acceptable values for this parameter are: 78 through 172799. 

The default value is 0 minutes. 

When managing a Group Policy Object (GPO), the default setting is NotConfigured. 

This parameter is only supported on Windows Server 2012.

```yaml
Type: UInt32[]
Parameter Sets: UNNAMED_PARAMETER_SET_2
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -GPOSession
Specifies the network GPO from which to retrieve the rules to be retrieved. 

This parameter is used in the same way as the **PolicyStore** parameter.
When modifying GPOs in Windows PowerShellÂ®, each change to a GPO requires the entire GPO to be loaded, modified, and saved back.
On a busy Domain Controller (DC), this can be a slow and resource-heavy operation.
A GPO Session loads a domain GPO onto the local computer and makes all changes in a batch, before saving it back.
This reduces the load on the DC and speeds up the Windows PowerShell cmdlets.
To load a GPO Session, use the Open-NetGPO cmdlet.
To save a GPO Session, use the Save-NetGPO cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Group
Specifies that only matching IPsec rules of the indicated group association are retrieved.
Wildcard characters are accepted. 

This parameter specifies the source string for the **DisplayGroup** parameter.
If the **DisplayGroup** parameter value is a localizable string, then this parameter contains an indirect string.
Rule groups can be used to organize rules by influence and allows batch rule modifications.
Using the Set-NetIPsecRule cmdlets, if the group name is specified for a set of rules or sets, then all of the rules or sets in that group receive the same set of modifications.
It is a good practice to specify this parameter value with a universal and world-ready indirect @FirewallAPI name. 
Note: The **DisplayGroup** parameter cannot be specified upon object creation using the New-NetIPsecRule cmdlet, but can be modified using dot-notation and the Set-NetIPsecRule cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: UNNAMED_PARAMETER_SET_2
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -InboundSecurity
Specifies that matching IPsec rules of the indicated security policy are retrieved. 

This parameter determines the degree of enforcement for security on inbound traffic. 
The acceptable values for this parameter are:

 -- None: No authentication is requested or required for connections that match the rule.
It specifies that the local computer does not attempt authentication for any network connections that match this rule.
This option is typically used to grant IPsec exemptions for network connections that do not need to be protected by IPsec, but would otherwise match other rules that could cause the connection to be dropped. 

 -- Request: Authentication is requested for connections that match the rule.
The local computer attempts to authenticate any inbound network connections that match this rule, but allows the connection if the authentication attempt is no successful. 

 -- Require: Authentication is required for connections that match the rule.
If the authentication is not successful, then the inbound network traffic is discarded. 

The default value is None. 

When the **OutboundSecurity** parameter is also specified, the following configurations are valid: 
**InboundSecurity**\**OutboundSecurity** = None\None, Request\None, Request\Request, Require\Request, or Require\Require.

```yaml
Type: SecurityPolicy[]
Parameter Sets: UNNAMED_PARAMETER_SET_2
Aliases: SecIn

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -IPsecRuleName
Specifies that only matching IPsec rules of the indicated name are retrieved.
Wildcard characters are accepted. 

This parameter acts just like a file name, in that only one rule with a given name may exist in a policy store at a time.
During group policy processing and policy merge, rules that have the same name but come from multiple stores being merged, will overwrite one another so that only one exists.
This overwriting behavior is desirable if the rules serve the same purpose.
For instance, all of the firewall rules have specific names, so if an administrator can copy these rules to a GPO, and the rules will override the local versions on a local computer.
GPOs can have precedence.
So if an administrator has a different or more specific rule with the same name in a higher-precedence GPO, then it overrides other rules that exist. 

The default value is a randomly assigned value. 

When the defaults for the main mode encryption need to be overridden, specify the customized parameters and set this parameter value, making this parameter the new default setting for encryption.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: UNNAMED_PARAMETER_SET_8
Aliases: ID,Name

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -KeyModule
Specifies that matching IPsec rules of the indicated key module are retrieved. 

This parameter specifies which keying modules to negotiate. 
The acceptable values for this parameter are: Default, AuthIP, IKEv1, or IKEv2. 

 -- Default: Equivalent to both IKEv1 and AuthIP.
Required in order for the rule to be applied to computers running Windows versions prior to nextref_server_7. 

 ---- Note: There are authorization and cryptographic methods that are only compatible with certain keying modules.
This is a very advanced setting intended only for specific interoperability scenarios.
Overriding this parameter value may result in traffic being sent in plain-text if the authorization and cryptographic settings are not supported by the keying modules there. 

 -- AuthIP: Supported with phase 2 authentication. 

 -- IKEv1: Supported with pre-shared key (PSK), Certificates, and Kerberos. 

 -- IKEv2: Not supported with Kerberos, PSK, or NT LAN Manager (NTLM). 
Note: Windows versions prior to Windows Server 2012 only support the Default configuration.

```yaml
Type: KeyModule[]
Parameter Sets: UNNAMED_PARAMETER_SET_2
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Machine
Specifies that matching IPsec rules of the indicated computer accounts are retrieved. 

This parameter specifies that only network packets that are authenticated as incoming from or outgoing to a computer identified in the list of computer accounts (SID) match this rule.
This parameter value is specified as an SDDL string.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: UNNAMED_PARAMETER_SET_2
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Mode
Specifies that matching IPsec rules of the indicated mode are retrieved. 

This parameter specifies the type of IPsec mode connection that the IPsec rule defines. 
The acceptable values for this parameter are: None, Transport, or Tunnel. 

The default value is Transport.

```yaml
Type: IPsecMode[]
Parameter Sets: UNNAMED_PARAMETER_SET_2
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -OutboundSecurity
Specifies that matching IPsec rules of the indicated security policy are retrieved. 

This parameter determines the degree of enforcement for security on outbound traffic. 
The acceptable values for this parameter are:

 -- None: No authentication is requested or required for connections that match the rule.
It specifies that the local computer does not attempt authentication for any network connections that match this rule.
This option is typically used to grant IPsec exemptions for network connections that do not need to be protected by IPsec, but would otherwise match other rules that could cause the connection to be dropped. 

 -- Request: Authentication is requested for connections that match the rule.
The local computer attempts to authenticate any outbound network connections that match this rule, but allows the connection if the authentication attempt fails. 

 -- Require: Authentication is required for connections that match the rule.
If the authentication is not successful, then the outbound network traffic is discarded. 

The default value is None. 

When the **InboundSecurity** parameter is also specified, the following configurations are valid: 
**InboundSecurity**/**OutboundSecurity** = None\None, Request\None, Request\Request, Require\Request, or Require\Require.

```yaml
Type: SecurityPolicy[]
Parameter Sets: UNNAMED_PARAMETER_SET_2
Aliases: SecOut

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Phase1AuthSet
Gets the IPsec rules that are associated with the given phase 1 authentication set to be retrieved. 

A NetIPsecPhase1AuthSet object represents the phase 1 authorization set conditions associated with an IPsec or main mode rule.
This parameter sets the methods for main mode negotiation by describing the proposals for computer authentication.
See the Get-NetIPsecPhase1AuthSet cmdlet for more information. 

Alternatively, the **Phase2AuthSet** parameter can be used for the same purpose, but does not allow the authentication set to be piped into the cmdlet and the set must be specified with the **IPsecRuleName** parameter.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: UNNAMED_PARAMETER_SET_2
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Phase2AuthSet
Gets the IPsec rules that are associated with the given phase 2 authentication set to be retrieved. 

A NetIPsecPhase2AuthSet object represents the phase 2 authorization set conditions associated with an IPsec or main mode rule.
This parameter sets the methods for main mode negotiation by describing the proposals for computer authentication.
See the Get-NetIPsecPhase2AuthSet cmdlet for more information. 

Alternatively, the **Phase1AuthSet** parameter can be used for the same purpose, but does not allow the authentication set to be piped into the cmdlet and the set must be specified with the **IPsecRuleName** parameter.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: UNNAMED_PARAMETER_SET_2
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -PolicyStore
Specifies the policy store from which to retrieve the rules to be retrieved. 

A policy store is a container for firewall and IPsec policy. 
The acceptable values for this parameter are:

 -- PersistentStore: Sometimes called static rules, this store contains the persistent policy for the local computer.
This policy is not from GPOs, and has been created manually or programmatically (during application installation) on the computer.
Rules created in this store are attached to the ActiveStore and activated on the computer immediately. 

 -- ActiveStore: This store contains the currently active policy, which is the sum of all policy stores that apply to the computer.
This is the resultant set of policy (RSOP) for the local computer (the sum of all GPOs that apply to the computer), and the local stores (the PersistentStore, the static Windows service hardening (WSH), and the configurable WSH). 

 ---- GPOs are also policy stores.
Computer GPOs can be specified as follows. 

 ------ `-PolicyStore hostname`. 

 ---- Active Directory GPOs can be specified as follows. 

 ------ `-PolicyStore domain.fqdn.com\GPO_Friendly_Namedomain.fqdn.comGPO_Friendly_Name`. 

 ------ Such as the following. 

 -------- `-PolicyStore localhost`

 -------- `-PolicyStore corp.contoso.com\FirewallPolicy`

 ---- Active Directory GPOs can be created using the New-GPO cmdlet or the Group Policy Management Console. 

 -- RSOP: This read-only store contains the sum of all GPOs applied to the local computer. 

 -- SystemDefaults: This read-only store contains the default state of firewall rules that ship with Windows Server 2012. 

 -- StaticServiceStore: This read-only store contains all the service restrictions that ship with Windows Server 2012.
Optional and product-dependent features are considered part of Windows Server 2012 for the purposes of WFAS. 

 -- ConfigurableServiceStore: This read-write store contains all the service restrictions that are added for third-party services.
In addition, network isolation rules that are created for Windows Store application containers will appear in this policy store. 

The default value is PersistentStore. 
Note: The Set-NetIPsecRule cmdlet cannot be used to add an object to a policy store.
An object can only be added to a policy store at creation time with the Copy-NetIPsecRule cmdlet or with the New-NetIPsecRule cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -PolicyStoreSource
Specifies that IPsec rules matching the indicated policy store source are retrieved. 

This parameter contains a path to the policy store where the rule originated if the object is retrieved from the ActiveStore with the TracePolicyStoreSource option set.
This parameter value is automatically generated and should not be modified. 

The monitoring output from this parameter is not completely compatible with the **PolicyStore** parameter.
This parameter value cannot always be passed into the **PolicyStore** parameter.
Domain GPOs are one example in which this parameter contains only the GPO name, not the domain name.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: UNNAMED_PARAMETER_SET_2
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -PolicyStoreSourceType
Specifies that IPsec rules that match the indicated policy store source type are retrieved. 

This parameter describes the type of policy store where the rule originated if the object is retrieved from the ActiveStore with the TracePolicyStoreSource option set.
This parameter value is automatically generated and should not be modified. 
The acceptable values for this parameter are:

 -- Local: The object originates from the local store. 

 -- GroupPolicy: The object originates from a GPO. 

 -- Dynamic: The object originates from the local runtime state.
This policy store name is not valid for use in cmdlets, but may appear when monitoring active policy. 

 -- Generated: The object was generated automatically.
This policy store name is not valid for use in cmdlets, but may appear when monitoring active policy. 

 -- Hardcoded: The object was hard-coded.
This policy store name is not valid for use in cmdlets, but may appear when monitoring active policy.

```yaml
Type: PolicyStoreType[]
Parameter Sets: UNNAMED_PARAMETER_SET_2
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -PrimaryStatus
Specifies that IPsec rules that match the indicated primary status are retrieved. 

This parameter specifies the overall status of the rule. 

 -- OK: Specifies that the rule will work as specified. 

 -- Degraded: Specifies that one or more parts of the rule will not be enforced. 

 -- Error: Specifies that the computer is unable to use the rule at all.

```yaml
Type: PrimaryStatus[]
Parameter Sets: UNNAMED_PARAMETER_SET_2
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -QuickModeCryptoSet
Specifies that matching IPsec rules of the specified quick mode cryptographic set are retrieved. 

This parameter specifies the quick mode cryptographic set to be associated with the IPsec rule. 

A NetIPsecMainModeCryptoSet object represents quick mode cryptographic conditions associated with an IPsec rule.
This parameter sets the methods for quick mode negotiation by describing the proposals for encryption.
See the New-NetIPsecQuickModeCryptoSet cmdlet for more information. 

Alternatively, the **AssociatedNetIPsecQuickModeCryptoSet** parameter can be used for the same purpose, but is used to pipe the input set into the rule. 
Note: When specifying cryptographic sets, the **IPsecRuleName** parameter value of the cryptographic set must be used.
The object cannot be directly passed to this cmdelt.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: UNNAMED_PARAMETER_SET_2
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RemoteTunnelHostname
Specifies that matching IPsec rules of the specified second end point tunnel host name are retrieved. 

Specifies a fully qualified DNS name that resolves to a list of remote tunnel end points. 

This parameter is only supported on Windows Server 2012. 
Note: This parameter can only be used with multiple remote tunnel end points.
Specifying this parameter prevents a non-asymmetric tunnel mode IPsec rule from being created.
Rule creation will fail when a single remote tunnel end point and this parameter are specified, or when remote tunnel end point is Any and this parameter is specified.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: UNNAMED_PARAMETER_SET_2
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RequireAuthorization
Indicates that matching IPsec rules of the specified value are retrieved. 

Specifies the given value for an IPsec rule. 

If this parameter is set to True, then enforcement of authorization is allowed for end points. 

This parameter is only supported on nextref_server_7 and later.

```yaml
Type: Boolean[]
Parameter Sets: UNNAMED_PARAMETER_SET_2
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Status
Specifies that IPsec rules that match the indicated status are retrieved. 

This parameter describes the status message for the specified status code value.
The status code is a numerical value that indicates any syntax, parsing, or runtime errors in the rule or set.
This parameter value should not be modified.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: UNNAMED_PARAMETER_SET_2
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ThrottleLimit
Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -TracePolicyStore
Specifies that the name of the source GPO is queried and set to the **PolicyStoreSource** parameter value.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -User
Specifies that matching IPsec rules of the indicated user accounts are retrieved. 

This parameter specifies that only network packets that are authenticated as incoming from or outgoing to a user identified in the list of user accounts match this rule.
This parameter value is specified as an SDDL string.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: UNNAMED_PARAMETER_SET_2
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
