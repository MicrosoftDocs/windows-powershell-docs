description: |-
  The **New-NetSwitchTeam** cmdlet creates a new switch team.
  A switch team must have a name for the team and must be created with one or more members, or network adapters.

  The network switch team is a team that is controlled by a Hyper-V extensible switch forwarding extension.
  No other cmdlets can be used to manage a switch team and the NetSwitchTeam cmdlets must not be used to manage standard, or non-switch, network adapter teams.
