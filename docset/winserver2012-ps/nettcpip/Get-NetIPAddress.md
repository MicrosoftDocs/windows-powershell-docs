# Get-NetIPAddress

## SYNOPSIS
Gets information about IP address configuration.

## SYNTAX

```
Get-NetIPAddress [[-IPAddress] <String[]>] [-AddressFamily <AddressFamily[]>] [-AddressState <AddressState[]>]
 [-AsJob] [-AssociatedIPInterface <CimInstance>] [-CimSession <CimSession[]>] [-InterfaceAlias <String[]>]
 [-InterfaceIndex <UInt32[]>] [-PolicyStore <String>] [-PreferredLifetime <TimeSpan[]>]
 [-PrefixLength <Byte[]>] [-PrefixOrigin <PrefixOrigin[]>] [-SkipAsSource <Boolean[]>]
 [-SuffixOrigin <SuffixOrigin[]>] [-ThrottleLimit <Int32>] [-Type <Type[]>] [-ValidLifetime <TimeSpan[]>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Get-NetIPAddress** cmdlet gets the IP address information such as IPv4 addresses, IPv6 addresses and the IP interfaces with which addresses are associated. 

This cmdlet also gets the **PrefixLength**, also known as a subnet mask.
For more information on subnetting, see Subnetting on TechNethttp://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb726997.aspx (http://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb726997.aspx) on TechNet. 

This cmdlet does not get the gateway as that is a routing concept covered by the Get-NetRoute cmdlet.
For IP endpoints, the gateway specifies the forwarding address or the next hop IP address over which the set of addresses defined by the network destination and subnet mask are reachable. 

Without parameters, this cmdlet gets all of the IP address configuration information on the computer.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
PS C:\>Get-NetIPAddress -AddressFamily IPv6
```

This example gets information about IP address configuration for all IPv6 addresses on the computer.

### EXAMPLE 2
```
PS C:\>Get-NetIPAddress | Format-Table
```

This example gets information about IP address configuration, and it displays some of that information in a table.
The table format provides a convenient overview for computers with many IP addresses.

### EXAMPLE 3
```
PS C:\>Get-NetIPAddress -InterfaceIndex 12
```

This example gets information about IP address configuration for a specific interface index.

### EXAMPLE 4
```
PS C:\>Get-NetIPAddress | Sort-Object -Property InterfaceIndex | Format-Table
```

This example gets information about IP address configuration, sorts them numerically by the interface index in the cmdlet name, and then displays them in a table format.
This display can help you find IP address information by interface index.

### EXAMPLE 5
```
PS C:\>Get-NetIPAddress | Where-Object -FilterScript { $_.ValidLifetime -Lt ([TimeSpan]::FromDays(1)) }


Similarly, this cmdlet can be used to get information about IP address configuration for IP addresses that have an Infinite ValidLifetime.
PS C:\>Get-NetIPAddress | Where-Object -FilterScript { $_.ValidLifetime -Eq ([TimeSpan]::MaxValue) }
```

This example gets information about IP address configuration for IP addresses that have a ValidLifetime of less than one day.
