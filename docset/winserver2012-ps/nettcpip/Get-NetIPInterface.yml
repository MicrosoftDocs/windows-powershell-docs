description: |-
  The **Get-NetIPInterface** cmdlet gets IP interface properties such as IPv4 addresses, IPv6 addresses and the IP interfaces to which these addresses are associated.
  Interface properties include properties such as DHCP is enabled or disabled, Wake on LAN (WoL) settings and IPv6 address auto-configuration settings.
  More information on IPv6 is available here IPv6 Address Autoconfiguration on TechNethttp://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc778502(WS.10).aspx. 

  This cmdlet does not get the gateway as that is a routing concept covered by the Get-NetRoute cmdlet.
  For IP endpoints, the gateway specifies the forwarding or next hop IP address over which the set of addresses defined by the network destination and subnet mask are reachable. 

  Without parameters, this cmdlet gets all of the IP interface properties on the computer, including virtual interfaces and loopback interfaces.
