  name: CongestionProvider
  description: |+
    Gets TCP setting information only for settings that have a specific CongestionProvider.
    CongestionProvider determines the congestion provider used by TCP.
    The CongestionProvider settings include (Default) the TCP stack uses its default setting.
    Servers use DCTCP by default.
    Clients use NewReno as defined in RFC 3782http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3782.txt; (CTCP) the TCP stack uses Compound TCP, which increases the receive window and amount of data sent.
    This may improve throughput on higher latency connections; (DCTCP) the TCP stack uses Datacenter TCP, which adjusts the TCP window size based on network congestion feedback based on ECN signaling.
    This may improve throughput on low latency links.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

     -- Default: The TCP settings that have the CongestionProvider as Default.

description: |-
  The **Get-NetTCPSetting** cmdlet gets information for each TCP setting.
  There will be different connection characteristics when connecting over a wide area network and within a data center.
  Thus each TCP setting is optimized for different network conditions including latency and congestion.
  The default application of the TCP setting is Automatic.
  To apply a TCP setting to a specific port number or destination IP address range, use the New-NetTransportFilter cmdlet.

  Without parameters, this cmdlet returns all TCP settings.
