parameters:
- type: <xref href="AddressFamily" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AddressFamily
  description: |+
    Specifies an IP address family of the neighbor cache entry.
    This property is automatically generated if unspecified.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

     -- IPv4: IPv4 address information. 

     -- IPv6: IPv6 address information.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    ps_cimcommon_asjob

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimSession" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a New-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967 or Get-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966 cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: InterfaceAlias
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the interface to which the neighbor is connected, using the InterfaceAlias property.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: InterfaceIndex
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the interface to which the neighbor is connected, using the InterfaceIndex property.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IPAddress
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the IP address of the neighbor cache entry.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: LinkLayerAddress
  description: |+
    Specifies the link layer address of the neighbor cache entry.
    This is also known as a MAC address.
    A link-layer address that uses IPv4 address syntax is a tunnel technology that encapsulates packets over an IPv4 tunnel, such as ISATAP or Teredo.
    A link-layer address of all zeroes indicates that the neighbor is unreachable and the neighbor cache entry does not have a link-layer address entry.
    An empty link-layer address indicates that the link layer does not use link-layer addresses, such as on a loopback interface.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PolicyStore
  description: |+
    Specifies the PolicyStore value.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

     -- ActiveStore: The IP address information is currently valid. 

     -- PersistentStore: The IP address information is persistent across reboots.
    When the computer starts, the PersistentStore settings are copied to the ActiveStore. 

    The default value is ActiveStore.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="State" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: State
  description: |+
    Specifies the state of the neighbor cache entry.
    A manually created entry in the neighbor cache only has one allowable state.
    That state is permanent: The neighbor is statically provisioned and will not expire unless deleted through configuration.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: NetTCPIP.New-NetNeighbor
name: New-NetNeighbor
description: |-
  The **New-NetNeighbor** cmdlet creates a neighbor cache entry for IPv4 or IPv6.
  The Neighbor cache maintains a list of information for each on-link neighbor, including the IP address and the associated link-layer address.
  Note: For successful creation of a neighbor entry, the address family of the neighbor cache entry must match the address family of the IP interface.
