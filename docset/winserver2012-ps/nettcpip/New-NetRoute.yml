    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/cimcmdlets/New-CimSession) or [Get-CimSession](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/cimcmdlets/Get-CimSession) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DestinationPrefix
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies a DestinationPrefix for the IP routing table entry.
    The DestinationPrefix contains an IP address prefix and a prefix length, separated by a slash (/).
    A DestinationPrefix of `0.0.0.0/0` for IPv4 or `::/0` for IPv6 would indicate that the NextHop is a default gateway.
    The PrefixLength must match the prefix specified in the DestinationPrefix, with all remaining address fields set to zero.

  defaultValue: Dhcp
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: InterfaceAlias
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the interface to which the IP routing table entry applies, as defined by the interface alias.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: InterfaceIndex
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the interface to which the IP routing table entry applies, as defined by the InterfaceIndex number.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: NextHop
  description: |+
    Specifies a next hop for the IP routing table entry.
    The NextHop is the IP address of the next hop in the route.
    A NextHop of `0.0.0.0` for IPv4 or `::` for IPv6 would indicate that the route is on-link.
    When the new routing table entry is created, the next hop IP address is also added as a neighbor cache entry.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PolicyStore
  description: |+
    Specifies the PolicyStore value.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

     -- ActiveStore: The IP address information is currently valid.

     -- PersistentStore: The IP address information is persistent across reboots.
    When the computer starts, the PersistentStore settings are copied to the ActiveStore.

    The default value is ActiveStore.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="TimeSpan" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PreferredLifetime
  description: |+
    Specifies a preferred lifetime for the IP routing table entry.
    When not specified this parameter is set as infinite.
    This parameter uses time as defined by the [TimeSpan](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.timespan.aspx) structure.


  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Publish" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Publish
  description: |+
    Specifies the Publish setting for the IP routing table entry.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

     -- No: The IP Route information is published and advertised in router advertisements with an infinite ValidLifetime.
    This is the default.

     -- Yes: The IP Route information is published and advertised in router advertisements with an infinite ValidLifetime.

     -- Age: The IP Route information is published and advertised in router advertisements with a finite ValidLifetime.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt16" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RouteMetric
  description: |+
    Specifies the route metric for the IP routing table entry.
    This parameter value specifies an integer cost metric for the route.
    This parameter value is added to the **InterfaceMetric** parameter value and the total value is used when choosing among multiple routes in the routing table that most closely match the destination address of a packet being forwarded.
    The route with the lowest, combined RouteMetric property and InterfaceMetric property value is chosen.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="TimeSpan" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ValidLifetime
  description: |+
    Specifies a ValidLifetime for the IP routing table entry.
    When not specified the ValidLifetime is set as infinite.
    ValidLifetime uses time as defined by the [TimeSpan](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.timespan.aspx) structure.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"

uid: NetTCPIP.New-NetRoute
name: New-NetRoute
description: |-
  The **New-NetRoute** cmdlet creates an entry in the IP routing table, including properties such as destination network prefixes, Next Hop IP addresses and Route Metrics.

  IP routing is the process of forwarding a packet based on the destination IP address.
  Routing occurs at a sending TCP/IP host and at an IP router. 

  In each case, the IP layer at the sending host or router must decide where to forward the packet.
  For IPv4, routers are also commonly referred to as gateways.
  To make these decisions, the IP layer consults a routing table stored in memory.
  Routing table entries are created by default when TCP/IP initializes, and entries can be added either manually or automatically.
  When the computer is routing, the RouteMetric property is added to the InterfaceMetric property, described as a part of NetIPInterface.
  This total value is used to decide the pass-through interface to send the forwarded packets.
  For more information, see [IP Routing](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb727001.aspx) on TechNet.

  Note: A gateway is a routing concept covered by the NetRoute cmdlets.
  For IP endpoints, the gateway specifies the forwarding or next hop IP address over which the set of addresses defined by the network destination and subnet mask are reachable.
