# Remove-NetIPAddress

## SYNOPSIS
Deletes an IP address and the configuration properties of that IP address.

## DESCRIPTION
The **Remove-NetIPAddress** cmdlet deletes IP address and the configuration properties of that IP address.
To remove a specific IP address object, be sure to use the IPv4 Address parameter or IPv6 Address parameter.
Other parameters will remove all IP addresses with the matching property.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
PS C:\>New-NetIPAddress -InterfaceIndex 12 -IPAddress 192.168.0.1


The remove cmdlet then removes it.
PS C:\>Remove-NetIPAddress -IPAddress 192.168.0.1
```

This example adds a new IP address.

### EXAMPLE 2
```
PS C:\>Get-NetIPAddress -IPAddress 192.168.0.1 | Remove-NetIPAddress
```

This example provides an alternative method to EXAMPLE 1 that removes all of the IP addresses that have an IP address of 192.168.0.1.

### EXAMPLE 3
```
PS C:\>Remove-NetIPAddress -PrefixOrigin Manual
```

This example removes all of the IP addresses that have a manually configured prefix origin.
