  name: AssociatedIPInterface
  description: |+

  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a New-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967 or Get-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966 cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm

  name: InputObject
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the input to this cmdlet.
    You can use this parameter, or you can pipe the input to this cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true

  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: InterfaceAlias
  description: |+
    Removes all of the neighbor cache entries that are connected to a specific interface, described by InterfaceAlias.

  defaultValue: None

  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: InterfaceIndex
  description: |+
    Removes all of the neighbor cache entries that are connected to a specific interface, described by InterfaceIndex.

  defaultValue: None

  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: IPAddress
  description: |+
    Removes all of the neighbor cache entries that have a specific IP address.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: LinkLayerAddress
  description: |+
    Specifies the link-layer address of the neighbor cache entry.
    This is also known as a MAC address.
    A link-layer address that uses IPv4 address syntax is a tunnel technology that encapsulates packets over an IPv4 tunnel, such as ISATAP or Teredo.
    A link-layer address of all zeroes indicates that the neighbor is unreachable and the neighbor cache entry does not have a link-layer address entry.
    An empty link-layer address indicates that the link layer does not use link-layer addresses, such as on a loopback interface.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PassThru
  description: |+
    Returns an object representing the item with which you are working.
    By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PolicyStore
  description: |+
    Specifies the PolicyStore value.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

     -- ActiveStore: The IP address information is currently valid. 

     -- PersistentStore: The IP address information is persistent across reboots.
    When the computer starts, the PersistentStore settings are copied to the ActiveStore. 

    The default value is ActiveStore.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="State" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: State
  description: |+
    Removes all of the neighbor cache entries that are in a specific state.
    The neighbor cache contains information maintained by Neighbor Unreachability Detection.
    A key piece of information is the reachability state of a neighbor.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

     -- Unreachable: The IP address is unreachable. 

     -- Incomplete: Address resolution is in progress and the link-layer address of the neighbor has not yet been determined. 

     -- Probe: The neighbor is no longer known to be reachable, and unicast Neighbor Solicitation probes are being sent to verify reachability. 

     -- Delay: The neighbor is no longer known to be reachable, and traffic has recently been sent to the neighbor.
    Rather than probe the neighbor immediately, however, the system will delay sending probes for a short while in order to give upper layer protocols a chance to provide reachability confirmation. 

     -- Stale: The neighbor is no longer known to be reachable but until traffic is sent to the neighbor, no attempt should be made to verify its reachability. 

     -- Reachable: The neighbor is known to have been reachable recently (within tens of seconds). 

     -- Permanent: The neighbor is statically provisioned and will not expire unless deleted through configuration. 

     -- Maximum: A maximum value for testing purposes.

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"

description: |-
  The **Remove-NetNeighbor** cmdlet deletes a neighbor cache entry for IPv4 or IPv6.
  The neighbor cache maintains a list of information for each on-link neighbor, including the IP address and the associated MAC address.
