  name: RouteMetric
  description: |+
    Removes all of the IP routes that have a specific route metric.
    This parameter value specifies an integer cost metric for the route.
    This parameter value is added to the **InterfaceMetric** parameter value and the total value is used when choosing among multiple routes in the routing table that most closely match the destination address of a packet being forwarded.
    The route with the lowest, combined RouteMetric property and InterfaceMetric property value is chosen.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""

- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

uid: NetTCPIP.Remove-NetRoute
name: Remove-NetRoute
description: |-
  The **Remove-NetRoute** cmdlet deletes an entry or entries from the IP routing table, including destination network prefixes, Next Hop IP addresses and Route Metrics.
  Parameters can be used to specify a set of routes to delete.

  IP routing is the process of forwarding a packet based on the destination IP address.
  Routing occurs at a sending TCP/IP host and at an IP router. 

  In each case, the IP layer at the sending host or router must decide where to forward the packet.
  For IPv4, routers are also commonly referred to as gateways.
  To make these decisions, the IP layer consults a routing table stored in memory.
  Routing table entries are created by default when TCP/IP initializes, and entries can be added either manually or automatically.
  When the computer is routing, the RouteMetric property is added to the InterfaceMetric property, described as a part of NetIPInterface.
  This total value is used to decide the pass-through interface to send the forwarded packets.
  For more information, see IP Routing on TechNethttp://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb727001.aspx.

  Without parameters, the Get-NetRoute cmdlet deletes all of the routes on the server.
