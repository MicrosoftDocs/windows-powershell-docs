parameters:
- type: <xref href="AddressFamily" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: AddressFamily
  description: |+
    Modifies an IP address family of the neighbor cache entry.
    This property is automatically generated if unspecified.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

     -- IPv4: IPv4 address information. 

     -- IPv6: IPv6 address information.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+

  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimSession" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a New-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967 or Get-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966 cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimInstance" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: InputObject
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the input to this cmdlet.
    You can use this parameter, or you can pipe the input to this cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: InterfaceAlias
  description: |+
    Specifies the interface to which the neighbor is connected, using InterfaceAlias.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: InterfaceIndex
  description: |+
    Specifies the interface to which the neighbor is connected, using InterfaceIndex.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: IPAddress
  description: |+
    Specifies the IP address of the neighbor cache entry.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: LinkLayerAddress
  description: |+
    Specifies the link layer address of the neighbor cache entry.
    This is also known as a MAC address.
    A link-layer address that uses IPv4 address syntax is a tunnel technology that encapsulates packets over an IPv4 tunnel, such as ISATAP or Teredo.
    A link-layer address of all zeroes indicates that the neighbor is unreachable and the neighbor cache entry does not have a link-layer address entry.
    An empty link-layer address indicates that the link layer does not use link-layer addresses, such as on a loopback interface.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PassThru
  description: |+
    Returns an object representing the item with which you are working.
    By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PolicyStore
  description: |+
    Specifies the PolicyStore value.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

     -- ActiveStore: The IP address information is currently valid. 

     -- PersistentStore: The IP address information is persistent across reboots.
    When the computer starts, the PersistentStore settings are copied to the ActiveStore. 

    The default value is ActiveStore.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="State" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: State
  description: |+
    Specifies the state of the neighbor cache entry.
    It is only possible to modify neighbor cache entries that are in a permanent state.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"

  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: NetTCPIP.Set-NetNeighbor
name: Set-NetNeighbor
description: |-
  The **Set-NetNeighbor** cmdlet modifies a neighbor cache entry for IPv4 or IPv6.
  The neighbor cache maintains a list of information for each on-link neighbor, including the IP address and the associated link-layer address.
  It is only possible to modify neighbor cache entries in a permanent state on interfaces that have link-layer addresses.
