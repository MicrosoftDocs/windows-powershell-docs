    Specifies the next hop used in the IP route.
    This parameter value is the IP address of the next hop in the route.
    A next hop of `0.0.0.0` for IPv4 or `::` for IPv6 would indicate that the route is on-link.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PassThru

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PolicyStore
  description: |+
    Specifies the PolicyStore value.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

     -- ActiveStore: The IP address information is currently valid. 

     -- PersistentStore: The IP address information is persistent across reboots.
    When the computer starts, the PersistentStore settings are copied to the ActiveStore. 

    The default value is ActiveStore.

    This parameter value uses time as defined by the TimeSpanhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.timespan.aspx structure.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Publish" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Publish
  description: |+
    Modifies the publish setting of the IP route.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

     -- No: The IP Route information is not published nor advertised in router advertisements. 

     -- Yes: The IP Route information is published and advertised in router advertisements with an infinite **ValidLifetime** parameter. 

     -- Age: The IP Route information is published and advertised in router advertisements with a finite **ValidLifetime** parameter. 

    The default value is No.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

- type: <xref href="UInt16" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RouteMetric
  description: |+
    Modifies the metric associated with the IP route.
    This parameter value specifies an integer cost metric for the route.
    This parameter value is added to the **InterfaceMetric** parameter value and the total value is used when choosing among multiple routes in the routing table that most closely match the destination address of a packet being forwarded.
    The route with the lowest, combined RouteMetric property and InterfaceMetric property value is chosen.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="TimeSpan" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ValidLifetime

uid: NetTCPIP.Set-NetRoute
name: Set-NetRoute
description: |-
  The **Set-NetRoute** cmdlet modifies an entry or entries in the IP routing table.
  This cmdlet has 2 types of parameters.
  One set of parameters specifies the routing table entry or entries to be modified.
  A destination prefix must be used and next hop address must be used as an identifier and additional properties may be included such as InterfaceIndex.
  The second set of parameters modifies properties in that NetIPAddress object.
  These properties include Type, PrefixLength, valid or preferred lifetime and skip as source.

  IP routing is the process of forwarding a packet based on the destination IP address.
  Routing occurs at a sending TCP/IP host and at an IP router. 

  In each case, the IP layer at the sending host or router must decide where to forward the packet.
  For IPv4, routers are also commonly referred to as gateways.
  To make these decisions, the IP layer consults a routing table stored in memory.
  Routing table entries are created by default when TCP/IP initializes, and entries can be added either manually or automatically.
  When the computer is routing, the RouteMetric property is added to the InterfaceMetric property, described as a part of NetIPInterface.
  This total value is used to decide the pass-through interface to send the forwarded packets.
  For more information, see IP Routing on TechNethttp://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb727001.aspx.

  NetRoute objects do not allow the DestinationPrefix or NextHop properties to be modified after creation.
  To modify these values, remove the NetRoute object and re-create it using the New-NetRoute cmdlet.

  Note: A gateway is a routing concept covered by the Get-NetRoute cmdlet.
  For IP end points, the gateway specifies the forwarding or next hop IP address over which the set of addresses defined by the network destination and subnet mask are reachable.

  Without parameters, the Get-NetRoute cmdlet modifies the routing table for all of the routes on the computer.
