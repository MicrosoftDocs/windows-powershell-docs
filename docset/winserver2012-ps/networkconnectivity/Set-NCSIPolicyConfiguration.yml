    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a New-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967 or Get-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966 cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  name: CorporateDNSProbeHostAddress
  description: |+
    Specifies the value to be configured. 

    This is the expected address of the host name used as for DNS probe.
    Successful resolution of the host name to this address indicates corporate connectivity, such as `2001::32`

  defaultValue: None
  position: "2"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CorporateDNSProbeHostName
  description: |+
    Specifies the value to be configured. 

    This is the host name of a PC known to be on the corporate network.
    Successful resolution of this host name to the expected address indicates corporate connectivity, such as `http://contoso.com`

  defaultValue: None
  position: "3"
  aliases: ""

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CorporateSitePrefixList
  description: |+
    Specifies the value to be configured. 

    This is the list of IPv6 corporate site prefixes that should be monitored for corporate connectivity.
    Reachability of addresses with any of these prefixes indicates corporate connectivity, such as `fe90::/9`, `fe81::/8`

  defaultValue: None
  position: "4"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CorporateWebsiteProbeURL
  description: |+

    This is the URL of the corporate website that will be used to perform an active probe against, such as `http://contoso.com`

  defaultValue: None
  position: "5"

  name: DomainLocationDeterminationURL
  description: |+
    Specifies the value to be configured. 

    This is the HTTPS URL of the corporate website that will be used to determine the current domain location, such as inside or outside the corporate domain.
    Reachability of the URL indicates that the location is inside corporate else it is outside, such as `https://contoso.com`

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: GPOSession
  description: |+
    Specifies the Group Policy session for which the cmdlet should pull configuration information from.
    This parameter can be used in conjunction with the NetGPO cmdlet family to aggregate multiple operations that are performed on a Group Policy Object. 

    This parameter cannot be used in conjunction with the **PolicyStore** parameter. 

    Using this parameter allows multiple cmdlets to be aggregated to run against a local GPO cache. 

    This is a common parameter across networking with very little difference between them.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimInstance" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: InputObject

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PassThru
  description: |+
    Sends items from the interactive window down the pipeline as input to other cmdlets.
    By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.
    This parameter is equivalent to using the Multiple value of the **OutputMode** parameter. 

    To send items from the interactive window down the pipeline, click to select the items and then click OK.
    Shift-click and Ctrl-click are supported.

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PolicyStore
  description: |+
    Specifies the policy store for which the cmdlet should pull configuration information from.
    This cmdlet supports getting information from a Group Policy Object, in the form `Domain\GPOName`. 

    The types of PolicyStore supported by this cmdlet: 

     - `Domain\GPOName`

     - `GPO: ComputerName`

    This is a common parameter across networking with very little difference between them.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
