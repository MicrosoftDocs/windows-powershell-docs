parameters:
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: HandlingPriority
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the handling priority for the cluster node.
    This is only applicable when the filtering mode of the port rule is Single host.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: HostName
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the cluster host against which this cmdlet is run.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `.` is entered, then the local cluster is assumed.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: hn
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="PortRule" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: InputObject
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the cluster port rule on which the handling priority will be set.
    This is only applicable when the filtering mode for the port rule is Single host.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: InterfaceName
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the interface to which NLB is bound.
    This is the interface of the cluster against which this cmdlet is run.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="IPAddress" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IP
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the IP address for the cluster port rule on which the handling priority will be set.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Port
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies a port number within the port rule on which the node handling priority will be set.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:`0` through `65535`.

description: |-
  The **Set-NlbClusterPortRuleNodeHandlingPriority** cmdlet sets the host priority of a port rule for a specific Network Load Balancing (NLB) node.
  The host priority specifies a unique identifier (ID) for each node.
  The node with the lowest numerical priority among the current members of the cluster handles all of the network traffic on the cluster that is not covered by a port rule.
  You can override these priorities or provide load balancing for specific ranges of ports by specifying rules.
  If a new node joins the cluster and its priority conflicts with another node in the cluster, then the node is not accepted as part of the cluster.
  The rest of the cluster will continue to handle the traffic.

  This operation changes the configuration on all cluster nodes.
  As a result, the NLB cluster will have to restart the convergence process on all nodes to guarantee that configuration changes have been applied on all nodes and that a consistent state is reached.
  Any additional operations on the NLB cluster should not be initiated until all cluster nodes have completed the convergence process and are back to the converged state.
