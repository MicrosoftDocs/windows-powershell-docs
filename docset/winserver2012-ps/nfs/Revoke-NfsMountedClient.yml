description: |-
  The **Revoke-Nfs-MountedClient** cmdlet revokes a mounted client from a Network File System (NFS) server.
  When a mounted client is revoked, the NFS server removes all open states such as open files, locked files, and all the sessions that belong to that client.
  To revoke a mounted client, you must specify a client ID.
  You can use the **Get-NfsMountedClient** cmdlet to get all mounted clients and their IDs from an NFS server.
