# Add-VpnIPAddressRange

## SYNOPSIS
Adds a new IPv4 address range from which IPv4 addresses can be assigned to VPN clients.

## SYNTAX

```
Add-VpnIPAddressRange [-IPAddressRange] <String[]> [-AsJob] [-CimSession <CimSession[]>]
 [-ComputerName <String>] [-PassThru] [-ThrottleLimit <Int32>] [-Confirm] [-WhatIf]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Add-VpnIPAddressRange** cmdlet adds a new IPv4 address range from which IPv4 addresses can be assigned to VPN clients.

This cmdlet is only applicable if the IPv4 address assignment is originating from statically configured IP address pools.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
PS C:\>Add-VpnIPAddressRange -IPAddressRange 40.1.1.10, 40.1.1.30 -PassThru
```

This example adds the IP address range `40.1.1.10` (starting IP) through `40.1.1.30` (ending IP) to the IPv4 address pool for assignment to VPN clients.

## PARAMETERS

### -AsJob
ps_cimcommon_asjob

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -CimSession
Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a New-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967 or Get-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966 cmdlet.
The default is the current session on the local computer.

```yaml
Type: CimSession[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ComputerName
Specifies the IPv4 orIPv6 address, or host name, of the computer on which the VPN server computer specific tasks should be run.
If this parameter is specified, then the IPv4 address range is added on that VPN server.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -IPAddressRange
Specifies the IP address range that has to be added to the pool.
Consists of a start IP and an end IP.
The range should not overlap with an existing range.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: True
Position: 2
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -PassThru
Returns an object representing the item with which you are working.
By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ThrottleLimit
Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
The cmdlet is not run.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

## INPUTS

### None

## OUTPUTS

### Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure.CimInstance#VpnIPAddressRange
The `Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure.CimInstance` object is a wrapper class that displays Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) objects.
The path after the pound sign (`#`) provides the namespace and class name for the underlying WMI object.

The VpnIPAddressRange object consists of the following properties: 

The starting IPv4 address of the range that was added. 

The ending IPv4 address of the range that was added.
