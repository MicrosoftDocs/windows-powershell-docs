    The starting IPv4 address of the range that was added. 

    The ending IPv4 address of the range that was added.

  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a New-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967 or Get-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966 cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  name: ComputerName
  description: |+
    Specifies the IPv4 orIPv6 address, or host name, of the computer on which the VPN server computer specific tasks should be run.
    If this parameter is specified, then the IPv4 address range is added on that VPN server.

  defaultValue: None

  name: IPAddressRange
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the IP address range that has to be added to the pool.
    Consists of a start IP and an end IP.
    The range should not overlap with an existing range.

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.
