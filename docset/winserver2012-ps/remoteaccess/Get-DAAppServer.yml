    The `Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure.CimInstance` object is a wrapper class that displays Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) objects.
    The path after the pound sign (`#`) provides the namespace and class name for the underlying WMI object.

    The object consists of the following properties: 

    The list of application server security groups.
    Each security group is specified in the `Domain\GroupName` format. 

    The list of application server GPOs.
    Each GPO is specified in the `Domain\GPOName` format. 

    The properties of the connection to the application server.
    If there are no application servers configured, then the default value is NoE2EAuth, which means no end-to-end authentication is required. 

    Whether or not IPsec traffic protection is enabled.
    If there are no application servers configured, then the default value is Disabled.

  code: |-
    PS C:\> Get-DAAppServer -ComputerName edge1.corp.contoso.com
    SecurityGroupNameList : {corp.contoso.com\daappservergrp} 
    GpoName               : {corp.contoso.com\DirectAccess Application Server Settings}

    TrafficProtection     : Enabled
  description: |-
    This example lists the application security groups and the application servers Group Policy Objects (GPOs) configured with DA.
