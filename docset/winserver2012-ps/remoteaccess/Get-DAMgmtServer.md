# Get-DAMgmtServer

## SYNOPSIS
Displays the configured management servers.
Management server here refers to update servers, Domain Controllers and other servers.

## SYNTAX

```
Get-DAMgmtServer [-AsJob] [-CimSession <CimSession[]>] [-ComputerName <String>] [-ThrottleLimit <Int32>]
 [-Type <String>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Get-DAMgmtServer** cmdlet displays the configured management servers.
Management server here refers to update servers, Domain Controllers, and other servers.

The server addresses are displayed in the same format in which the addresses were originally added (IPv4 or IPv6 address, or host name).

Management server configuration is applicable globally, to the entire DirectAccess (DA) deployment and hence is not impacted by multi-site deployments.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
PS C:\> Get-DAMgmtServer -Type DC
DC1.corp.contoso.com
```

This example retrieves a list of all domain controllers which were configured automatically by DA and does not include the servers configured manually.
