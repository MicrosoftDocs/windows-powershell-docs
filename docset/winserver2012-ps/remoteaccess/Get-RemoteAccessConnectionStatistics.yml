    The `Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure.CimInstance` object is a wrapper class that displays Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) objects.
    The path after the pound sign (`#`) provides the namespace and class name for the underlying WMI object.

    For real-time statistics, the array of RemoteAccessConnection objects consists of the following properties.
    A separate instance of the object is output for every connection. 

     -- The user name of the user logged in. 

     -- The state of user activity on the connection, idle or active. 

     -- The bandwidth used by the connection. 

     -- The IPv4 address of the client computer. 

     -- The IPv6 address of the client computer. 

     -- The host name of the client computer. 

     -- The internet-facing IP address of the client. 

     -- The tunnel type: VPN tunnel or ESP tunnel for DA. 

     -- The transition technology used in the DA connection: native IPv6, Teredo, IPHTTPS, Isatap, 6to4. 

     -- The time stamp when the connection was setup. 

     -- The time duration of connection. 

     -- The total number of bytes received on the connection so far. 

     -- The total number of bytes sent on the connection so far. 

     -- The connection type: DA or VPN. 

     -- The health status: Indicates the NAP health status. 

     -- The authentication method used to authenticate the user and computer in VPN and DA. 

    For accounting statistics, the array of RemoteAccessConnection objects consists of the following properties.
    A separate instance of the object is outputted for every connection. 
    - The user name of the user logged in.

    - The IPv4 address of the client computer. 

     -- The IPv6 address of the client computer. 

     -- The host name of the client computer. 

     -- The internet-facing IP address of the client. 

     -- The tunnel type: VPN tunnel or ESP tunnel for DA. 

    - The transition technology used in the DA connection: native IPv6, Teredo, IPHTTPS, Isatap, 6to4. 

     -- The time stamp when the connection was setup. 

     -- The time duration of connection. 

     -- The total number of bytes received on the connection so far. 

     -- The total number of bytes sent on the connection so far. 

     -- The connection type: DA or VPN. 

     -- The health status: Indicates the NAP health status. 

     -- The authentication method used to authenticate the user and computer in VPN and DA.

    This example disconnects the connection by specifying the IP address of the host from which it originates.
    The output of the disconnect cmdlet displays the IP address of the disconnected host.
    For this example there is one active VPN connection.
    The output of this cmdlet is piped to the Format-Listhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=113302 cmdlet to display the details of the active connection in a list format.

    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a New-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967 or Get-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966 cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

description: |-
  The **Get-RemoteAccessConnectionStatistics** cmdlet displays the statistics of the real-time, currently active DirectAccess (DA) and VPN connections and the statistics of DA and VPN historical connections for a specified time duration

  The statistics for active and historical connections starting or ending on a Remote Access (RA) server are stored in the inbox accounting store on that server.
  This cmdlet retrieves statistics for a specific server.
  This cmdlet is not impacted by multi-site deployment. 

   -- If neither a start date nor an end date is specified, then statistics for active connections is retrieved. 

   -- In order to retrieve statistics of historical data, a time duration needs to be specified such as a start date, an end date, or both.
  If only one of them is specified then the time stamp on the first or last record in the accounting database is used to fill the missing information and to create a duration time.

  The statistics of active connections can be explicitly filtered by the resource accessed over the connections or by the security group that users who originated the connections belong to.
  These filters are not available for statistics of historical connections.
