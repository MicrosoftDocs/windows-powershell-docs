    The `Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure.CimInstance` object is a wrapper class that displays Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) objects.
    The path after the pound sign (`#`) provides the namespace and class name for the underlying WMI object.

    The VpnIPAddressRange object consists of the following properties: 

     -- The starting IPv4 address of the range that was deleted. 

     -- The ending IPv4 address of the range that was deleted.

  code: |-
    PS C:\>Remove-VpnIPAddressRange -IPAddress 30.1.1.10 -Passthru
    StartIPAddress                           EndIPAddress 
    --------------                           ------------ 
    30.1.1.10                                30.1.1.30
  description: |-
    This example removes the IP address range 30.1.1.10 (the starting IP address) through 30.1.1.30 (the ending IP address) from the IPv4 address pool for assignment to VPN clients.
    Only the starting IP address needs to be specified.
    This cmdlet automatically determines which IP address range that the starting IP corresponds.

    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a New-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967 or Get-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966 cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.
