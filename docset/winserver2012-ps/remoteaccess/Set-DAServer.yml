    This example enables Two-factor user authentication which enables users to use certificates for DA.
    There are multiple steps involved in enabling Two-factor authentication.
    By default, PKI is disabled during DA installation and will need to be enabled.
    This is achieved by provisioning an IPsec root certificate on the DA server using this cmdlet.
    The enterprise needs to have a certification authority (CA) which will provision this certificate for all domain joint computers.
    The first two steps in this example list out the certificates present in the root certificate store of the server computer and pick an appropriate one.
    In this case it happens to be the 13th certificate in the list.
    Using this cmdlet, the certificate is then assigned as the IPsec root certificate to enable PKI and the UserAuthentication is specified to be two-factor.

    This example enables clients to connect using Teredo.
    By default, Teredo is disabled unless two consecutive public IPv4 addresses are found on the internet facing interface of the server while installing DA.
    Before enabling Teredo, ensure that two consecutive public IP addresses are present.

    Specifies the prefix from which IPv6 addresses are assigned to the connecting clients in case of IP-HTTPS.
    The length should be 64 bits.
    In the case of a load balancing scenario the prefix length should be 59 bits. 

    The client IPv6 prefix configuration is applicable per-server or per-site as in the case of multi-site deployments.

  name: ConnectToAddress
  description: |+
    Specifies the DA server or NAT public, if DA server is deployed behind a NAT, address to which clients connect.
    Specified as host name or IPv4 address. 

    When the ConnectTo address is changed, the SSL certificate is also changed appropriately.
    Following are the rules associated with assigning a proper certificate. 

     -- This cmdlet looks for an appropriate SSL certificate on the computer. 

     -- If an appropriate SSL certificate is not found, then a self-signed certificate is created. 

     -- In the case of external load balancer configuration, if one or more computers are down, then the cmdlet bails out and the ConnectTo Address is not changed. 

     -- In a load balancing scenario, if all computers are up and an appropriate SSL certificate is found only on some computers, then the cmdlet fails the operation of changing the ConnectTo address.
    If none of the computers has a proper SSL certificate, then a self-signed certificate is created on all computers and the ConnectTo change goes through.
    If one or more computers are down, then the certificate is updated only on the other computers.
    But the DA server GPO is updated to ensure that when these computers come up load balancing is in stopped state on them due to a certificate mismatch.
    For the certificate change, and as a result the ConnectTo address change, to take effect the administrator needs to install a similar certificate with the same name on the computers and re-run this cmdlet.
    If a self-signed certificate is being used, then the user just needs to re-run the cmdlet and it automatically creates a self-signed certificate. 

     -- In a multi-site scenario, this cmdlet does not create a self-signed certificate and always expects a proper certificate to be present on the computer itself. 

    The ConnectTo address is applicable per-DA server or per-site, in the case of multi-site deployments.

  description: |+
    Specifies that computer certificate authentication is to be disabled.
    Disabling this setting disables PKI for the DA deployment. 

    Following are conditions for computer certificate authentication. 

     -- Computer certificate authentication cannot be disabled if health checks are enabled using the **HealthCheck** parameter or Two-factor authentication is used for user authentication or when multi-site deployment is enabled or when firstref_client_7 client support is enabled. 

     -- User authentication configuration is automatically changed to `UserPasswd` when computer certificate authentication is disabled. 

    Computer certificate authentication is re-enabled by configuring an IPsec root certificate using the **IPsecRootCertificate** parameter. 

    Disabling of computer certificate authentication is a global configuration that applies to the entire DA deployment.

  name: EntrypointName
  description: |+
    Specifies the identity of a site in a multi-site deployment and indicates that the DA server properties should be configured for that site.
    Only the following properties are applicable at the site level.
    The rest of the properties are global and therefore this parameter has no meaning to them. 

     -- ClientIPv6Prefix. 

     -- ConnectToAddress. 

     -- TeredoState. 

    If this parameter is not specified in a multi-site deployment, then the entry point name to which the server on which the cmdlet is run is used.
    The server could also be represented by using the **ComputerName** parameter. 

    If both this parameter and **ComputerName** parameter are specified and the computer name does not belong to the site represented by the entry point name, then the entry point takes precedence.

    When suppressed the cmdlet assumes user confirmation for the following conditions. 

     -- ConnectTo change would result in a change in the SSL certificate. 

     -- During SSL certificate change if an appropriate certificate is not found then a self-signed certificate is created. 

     -- Changing DA installation type.

    Specifies that health checks for DA clients are enabled or disabled.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

     -- Enabled. 

     -- Disabled. 

    The following are important behavioral aspects for health checks: 

     -- In order to enable health checks, computer certificate authentication should already be enabled, such as an IPsec root certificate should be deployed. 

     -- On disabling health checks, if neither of the following is already enabled, then computer certificate authentication is automatically disabled: 

     ---- Multi-site, such as multi-site is not deployed or enabled. 

     ---- User authentication is not two-factor. 

     ---- Support for down-level clients is not enabled.

    Configures the state of Teredo.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

     -- Enabled. 

     -- Disabled. 

    The following are the behavioral aspects of Teredo State. 

     -- Teredo can be enabled only if two consecutive Public IPv4 addresses are present on the Internet interface of the server. 

     -- In a load balancing scenario. 

     ---- If a 3rd party load balancer is being used and Teredo has to be enabled, then the load balancer should have two consecutive IP addresses.
    Additionally each DA server that is part of the Load balancer must have 2 consecutive public IPv4 addresses.

     ---- Teredo can be enabled on a cluster if the cluster has VIPs that are two consecutive public IPv4 addresses.
    If such IPs are not found, then the cluster should be destroyed first and two consecutive IPs should be configured on the DA server. 

     -- The Teredo configuration is applicable per-computer or per-site, in the case of multi-site deployments.
