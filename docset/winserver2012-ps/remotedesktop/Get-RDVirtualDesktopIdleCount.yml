  The **Get-RDVirtualDesktopIdleCount** cmdlet gets the number of idle virtual desktops on one or more hosts.
  This cmdlet retruns a value that represents the number of idle virtual desktops from every pool.

  An idle virtual desktop is a virtual machine that is in a running state and there is no user logged on to it.
  Idle virtual desktops continue to run even if you configured the pool so that the server saves a virtual desktop that is not in use.
