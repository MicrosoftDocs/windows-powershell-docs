description: |-
  Provides one or more standard, non-Administrator users access to event, service, performance counter, and role and feature inventory data for a server that you are managing, either locally or remotely, by using Server Manager.
  The cmdlet must be run locally on the server that you are managing by using Server Manager.
  The cmdlet works by performing the following actions:

  ●  Adds access rights for specified standard users to the root\cimv2 namespace on the local server (for access to role and feature inventory information).

    ●  Adds specified standard users to required user groups (Remote Management Users, Event Log Readers, and Performance Log Readers) that allow remote access to event and performance counter logs on the managed server.

    ●  Changes access rights in the Service Control Manager to allow specified standard users remote access to the status of services on the managed server.

  This cmdlet does not provide standard users access to bpa (BPA) results, or allow standard users to run BPA scans.
  Aside from the preceding list of changes, this cmdlet provides no additional access that a standard user does not already have, by default, on managed servers.

  Running this cmdlet has security implications for your network environment, because it grants specified non-Administrator users access rights to information that, by default, is restricted to members of the Administrators group on the local computer.
  The cmdlet provides access to other WMI providers in the root\cimv2 namespace, but only those providers that can be used by standard users.
  We recommend that you run this cmdlet only when you must add a specific standard user to the users who require access to remote server data by using Server Manager.
  Additionally, you should promptly run `Disable-ServerManagerStandardUserRemoting` to deny this access to users as soon as they no longer require it.
