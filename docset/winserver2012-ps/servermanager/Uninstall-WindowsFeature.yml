parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ComputerName
  description: |+
    Uninstalls and optionally removes one or more rrsandf_plural from a specified remote computer.
    This parameter accepts only one computer name.
    If this parameter is not added, or no computer name is specified, the default target is the local computer.

    Valid values for the parameter include a NetBIOS name, an IP address, or a fully qualified domain name of a remote computer that is running Windows Server 2012.

    To use an IP address of a remote computer as the value of this parameter, your command must include the `Credential` parameter.
    The computer must either be configured for HTTPS transport, or the IP address of the remote computer must be included in the WinRM TrustedHosts list on the local computer.
    For information about adding a computer name to the WinRM TrustedHosts list, see "How to Add a Computer to the Trusted Host List" in about_Remote_Troubleshootinghttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=135188.

    Specifies the uninstallation of all applicable management tools along with the roles, role services, or features that are specified in the `Name` parameter.
    Note that by default, management tools are not uninstalled when you run the `Uninstall-WindowsFeature` cmdlet; you must add this parameter to uninstall associated management tools.

  description: |+
    Deletes feature files for the specified rrsandf_plural from the side-by-side store, located at %SystemDrive%:\Windows\WinSxS.
    If the feature is not yet uninstalled, the command uninstalls the feature.

    When you delete feature files, features that depend upon the files you remove are also deleted.
    When you delete feature files for a subfeature, and no other subfeatures for the parent feature are installed, then files for the entire parent role or feature are deleted.

  name: Restart
  description: |+

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Vhd
  description: |+
    Specifies the path to an offline VHD.
    The path can either point to a VHD file, or to a location on which the VHD is already mounted by using Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tools.

    The VHD can be on a local disk on the target computer, or on a network shared folder.
    If the VHD is in a network shared folder, then the value of this parameter is a UNC path to the VHD.
    In this case, the computer account of the computer that you are using to mount the VHD must have read and write permissions (Read/Write permissions in the File Sharing dialog box, or Full Control on the Security tab of the folder Properties dialog box) on the shared folder, or the VHD will not be accessible.
    Local loopback UNC paths are not supported.
    Use either of the following formats for the computer account: DOMAIN\SERVERNAME$ or SERVERNAME$.

    Add the `ComputerName` parameter to specify the target computer you want to use to mount the VHD.
    If the `ComputerName` parameter is not specified, then the local computer is used.
    The computer that you are using to mount the VHD must be running Windows Server 2012.
    Any local path, such as D:\myFolder, that is specified by using this parameter is always relative to the target computer.

uid: ServerManager.Uninstall-WindowsFeature
name: Uninstall-WindowsFeature
description: |-
  The `Uninstall-WindowsFeature` cmdlet uninstalls and optionally removes specified roles, role services, and features from a computer that is running Windows Server 2012, or from an offline virtual hard disk (VHD) on which Windows Server 2012 is installed.
  This cmdlet works similarly to the Remove Roles and Features Wizard in Server Manager, with an important exception: by default, management tools are not uninstalled when you run the `Uninstall-WindowsFeature` cmdlet; you must add the `IncludeManagementTools` parameter to uninstall associated management tools.

  This cmdlet requires elevation; you must be running a Windows PowerShell session as an administrator to use this cmdlet.
