## SYNTAX

### UNNAMED_PARAMETER_SET_1
```
Close-SmbOpenFile [[-FileId] <UInt64[]>] [-AsJob] [-CimSession <CimSession[]>] [-ClientComputerName <String[]>]
 [-ClientUserName <String[]>] [-ClusterNodeName <String[]>] [-Force] [-PassThru] [-ScopeName <String[]>]
 [-SessionId <UInt64[]>] [-ThrottleLimit <Int32>] [-Confirm] [-WhatIf]
```

### UNNAMED_PARAMETER_SET_2
```
Close-SmbOpenFile [-AsJob] [-CimSession <CimSession[]>] [-Force] [-PassThru] [-ThrottleLimit <Int32>]
 -InputObject <CimInstance[]> [-Confirm] [-WhatIf]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Close-SMBOpenFile** cmdlet forcibly closes a file that is open by one of the clients of the Server Message Block (SMB) server.
This cmdlet should be used with care as it may result in data loss to the client for which the file is being closed if the client has not flushed all of the file modifications back to the server before the file is closed.

## EXAMPLES
