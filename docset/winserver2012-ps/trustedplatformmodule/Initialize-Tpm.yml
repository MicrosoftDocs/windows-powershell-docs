    - TpmReady. Whether the TPM is complies with Windows Server® 2012 standards.
    - RestartRequired. Whether the computer requires a restart to continue the provisioning process.
    - ShutdownRequired. Whether the computer must be shut down to continue the provisioning process.

    This command initializes a TPM.
    The **ForceClearAllowed** parameter means that the owner authorization value needs to be imported or reset in order for provisioning to continue.
    The **PhysicalPresenceAllowed** parameter means that a user must be present during a restart to continue the process.

    The cmdlet returns an object with information about the state of the provisioning process.
