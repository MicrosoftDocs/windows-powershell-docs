  The **Unblock-Tpm** cmdlet resets a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) lockout.
  TPM locks itself to prevent tampering or attack.
  This is called a lockout.
  To end a TPM lockout, you must provide a valid owner authorization value.
  You can enter an owner authorization value or specify a file that contains the value.
  If you do not provide a value, the cmdlet attempts to use a value stored in the registry.
