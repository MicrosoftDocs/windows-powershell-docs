description: |-
  The **Update-WASJob** cmdlet is used to add assessments, computers, and images to the job object in memory.
  After you add assets or assessments, you can invoke the job but you can't save it back to the Windows Assessment Services server.

  The **AddAssessment** parameter set adds assessments.
  The **AddAsset** parameter set adds computers, images, and unattended answer files.
  However, you can't combine these two parameter sets on the same command line.

  The **Job** parameter is required, and either the **Assessment** or the **Computer** parameter is also required.
