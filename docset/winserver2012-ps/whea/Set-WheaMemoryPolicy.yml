  Set-WheaMemoryPolicy [-ComputerName <String>] [-DisableOffline <Boolean>] [-DisablePFA <Boolean>]

   [-PersistMemoryOffline <Boolean>] [-PFAPageCount <UInt32>] [-PFAErrorThreshold <UInt32>]

examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Enable WHEA predictive failure analysis'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Set-WheaMemoryPolicy -DisablePFA $False
  description: |-
    This command enables PFA on the local computer.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 2: Change the memory time-out policy on a remote computer'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Set-WHEAMemoryPolicy -ComputerName "TestPC" -PFATimeout 600
  description: |-
    This command changes the WHEA memory policy on the remote computer named TestPC to use a timeout of 600 seconds.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 3: Get and set WHEA memory policy in a script'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>$MP = Get-WheaMemoryPolicy
    $MP.DisableOffline = $True
    $MP | Set-WheaMemoryPolicy
  description: |-
    The first command gets a memory policy, and then stores it in the $MP variable.

    The second command sets the **DisableOffline** property of the memory policy in $MP to $True.

    The last command passes the memory policy in $MP to **Set-WheaMemoryPolicy**.
  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ComputerName
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the computer on which to set the policy.
    If you do not specify this value, the cmdlet sets policy on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: CN
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DisableOffline
  description: |+
    Indicates, when set to $True, whether to prevent WHEA from removing memory pages in response to either corrected or uncorrected memory errors.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DisablePFA
  description: |+
    Indicates whether to stop WHEA from monitoring the memory pages that have corrected errors, and disables the predicative failure analysis algorithm.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PersistMemoryOffline
  description: |+
    Indicates whether to enable WHEA to persist memory offline decisions across computer reboots.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PFAErrorThreshold
  description: |+
    Specifies the number of corrected errors that must occur before a memory page in the PFA monitoring list is considered bad and taken offline.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PFAPageCount
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum size of the PFA monitoring list for pages that experience corrected memory errors.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PFATimeout
  description: |+
    Specifies the number of seconds that WHEA monitors a memory page using PFA.
    WHEA starts monitoring a memory page when the page has its first corrected error.

    WHEA stops monitoring a memory page when one of the following events occurs: 

    - The monitoring interval exceeds the *PfaTimeout* value. 
    - The number of detected errors exceeds the *PfaErrorThreshold* value.

  defaultValue: None

uid: WHEA.Set-WheaMemoryPolicy
name: Set-WheaMemoryPolicy
description: |-
  The **Set-WheaMemory** cmdlet sets the elements of the WHEA (Windows Hardware Error Architecture) memory policy on the specified computer.
  WHEA receives memory errors, corrected and uncorrected, from the platform and implements a Predictive Failure Analysis (PFA) algorithm based on corrected errors.
  WHEA attempts to remove from the available system memory the pages that have uncorrected errors, or are predicted to fail based on corrected errors.
  The removal decisions can be persisted across reboots.
  You can change the WHEA decision criteria against memory errors by tuning the WHEA memory policy.
  These policy elements can be set independently of each other.
  The new policy element values take effect immediately.

  WHEA memory policy elements are: 

  - DisableOffline.
  Disable decisions to take memory offline based on corrected or uncorrected errors.
  - DisablePFA.
  Disable predictive failure analysis (PFA) of memory pages based on the number of corrected errors reported in the page.
  - PersistMemoryOffline.
  Persist the decisions to take memory offline across reboots.
  This element applies to both corrected and uncorrected errors.
  - PFAPageCount.
  The maximum number of memory pages that WHEA monitors using PFA.
  - PFAErrorThreshold.
  The number of errors that need to occur within the timeout period for the page to be candidate for removal.
  - PFATimeout.
  The number of seconds before PFA takes a page out of the monitoring list.
