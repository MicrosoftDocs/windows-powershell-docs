# Add-WBSystemState

## SYNOPSIS
Adds the system state components to the backup policy.

## SYNTAX

```
Add-WBSystemState [-Policy] <WBPolicy>
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Add-WBSystemState** cmdlet adds the system state components to a policy contained in the specified **WBPolicy** object.
Use backups created through this policy to perform a system state recovery.

The **WBPolicy** object must be in edit mode.
To put the **WBPolicy** object in edit mode for a policy that is set as the scheduled backup policy, use the Get-WBPolicy cmdlet with the **Editable** parameter.
The New-WBPolicy cmdlet creates a new **WBPolicy** object that is already in edit mode.

To use this or any other Windows Server 2012 Backup cmdlets, you must be a member of the Administrators group or Backup Operators group.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Add system state to the backup policy
```
PS C:\>$Policy = Get-WBPolicy PS C:\> Add-WBSystemState -Policy $Policy
```

This example adds a setting to the **WBPolicy** object to include the system state in backups that you create by using this policy.

The first command stores the result of the **Get-WBPolicy** cmdlet in the variable named **$Policy**.

The second command adds the system state to the backup policy in the **$Policy** variable.
