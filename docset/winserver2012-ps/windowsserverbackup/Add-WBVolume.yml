    This example adds a list of volumes for backup to the **WBPolicy** object.

    The first command stores the output of the Get-WBVolume cmdlet in the variable named **$Volumes**.

    The second command calls the Get-WBPolicy cmdlet and assigns the result to the **$Policy** variable.

    The third command adds the volumes in the **$Volumes** variable to the backup policy.
