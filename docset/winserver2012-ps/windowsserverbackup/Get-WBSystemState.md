# Get-WBSystemState

## SYNOPSIS
Gets a Boolean value that indicates whether system state recovery was added to the backup policy.

## SYNTAX

```
Get-WBSystemState [-Policy] <WBPolicy>
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Get-WBSystemState** cmdlet gets a Boolean value that indicates whether the ability to perform system state recoveries along with the backups was added to the **WBPolicy** object.
If the system state is not in the list of items to be backed up, use the Add-WBSystemState cmdlet to add it to the list.

To use this or any other Windows Server 2012 Backup cmdlets, you must be a member of the Administrators group or Backup Operators group.

## EXAMPLES

```
PS C:\>$Policy = Get-WBPolicy PS C:\> Get-WBSystemState -Policy $Policy
```

This example displays a Boolean value that indicates whether the system state setting was added to the **WBPolicy** object **$Policy**.
The system state setting enables you to use the backups to perform system state recoveries.

The second command displays the result of the **Get-WBSystemState** cmdlet using the variable named **$Policy**.
