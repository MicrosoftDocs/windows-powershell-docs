- title: 'Example 1: Add a file to a backup file specification'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> $Filespec = New-WBFileSpec -FileSpec C:\Sample\1.jpg

    The WBFileSpec object that specifies the file C:\Sample\1.jpg for backup.
  description: |-
    This command creates a file specification and adds the file named "C:\Sample\1.jpg" to it.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 2: Add a folder recursively to a backup file specification'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> $Filespec = New-WBFileSpec -FileSpec "C:\Sample"
  description: |-
    This command creates a file specification and adds the contents of the C:\Sample folder to it.
    Because the cmdlet does not include the *NonRecursive* parameter, the backup includes the contents of this folder and its subfolders.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 3: Add a folder nonrecursively to a backup file specification'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> $Filespec = New-WBFileSpec -FileSpec "C:\Sample" -NonRecursive
  description: |-
    This command creates a file specification and adds the contents of the C:\Sample folder to it.
    Because the cmdlet includes the *NonRecursive* parameter, the backup includes the contents of this folder but not the contents of its subfolders.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 4: Exclude files from a backup file specification'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> $Filespec = New-WBFileSpec -FileSpec C:\Sample\*.mp3 -Exclude

    The WBFileSpec object that specifies the exclusion of*.mp3 files during backup under the path C:\Sample.
  description: |-
    This command creates an exclusion file specification for MP3 files in the "C:\Sample" folder.
    The backup excludes MP3 files in "C:\Sample" and its subfolders.

description: |-
  The **New-WBFileSpec** cmdlet creates a **WBFileSpec** object that contains a backup file specification.
  A **WBFileSpec** object defines the items the items that a backup includes or excludes.
  You can add a backup file specification to a **WBPolicy** object as a source for backup.

  You can use this cmdlet to include multiple files, folders, or volumes.
  Specify volume paths by using volume drive letters, volume mount points, or GUID-based volume names.
  If you use a GUID-based volume name, ensure that it ends with a backslash (\\).
  You can use wildcard characters (*) in file names to specify a path to a file or to specify a file type to include or exclude.

  If you specify a path to exclude from the backup, that path must be part of an inclusion file specification in the policy.
  Otherwise, the backup ignores the exclusion path.
