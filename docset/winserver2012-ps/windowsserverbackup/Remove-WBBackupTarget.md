# Remove-WBBackupTarget

## SYNOPSIS
Removes backup storage locations from a backup policy.

## SYNTAX

```
Remove-WBBackupTarget [-Policy] <WBPolicy> [-Target] <WBBackupTarget>
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Remove-WBBackupTarget** cmdlet removes backup storage locations from a backup policy.
**WBBackupTarget** objects define backup storage locations.
A **WBPolicy** object defines the backup policy.

Before you can remove a backup target from a **WBPolicy** object, you must put the **WBPolicy** object in edit mode.
To put the **WBPolicy** object in edit mode for a policy that you have set as the scheduled backup policy, use the Get-WBPolicy cmdlet with the **Editable** parameter.
The New-WBPolicy cmdlet creates a new **WBPolicy** object that is already in edit mode.

If you specify a disk as a storage location for backups, the server formats the disk before use and permanently deletes any existing data on the disk.

You can add only one storage type at a time to a policy.
If you specify a shared folder as the storage location, you cannot add more locations because you can specify only one shared folder as a storage location at any time.
However, you can specify multiple disks or volumes at one time by calling the Add-WBBackupTarget cmdlet for each location.

To use Windows ServerÂ® 2012 Backup cmdlets, you must be a member of the Administrators group or Backup Operators group.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Remove a backup target from a backup policy
```
PS C:\>$Policy = Get-WBPolicy PS C:\>$BackupLocations = Get-WBBackupTarget -Policy $Policy PS C:\>Remove-WBBackupTarget -Policy $Policy -Target $BackupLocations[0]
```

This example removes a **WBBackupTarget** object from a **WBPolicy** object and then displays a list of backup locations left in the policy.

The first command gets the current backup policy and stores it in a variable named **$Policy**.

The second command gets the backup target locations and stores them in the variable named **$BackupLocations**.
It also stores the backup policy in the variable named **$Policy**.

The third command removes the backup target in the first element of the **$BackupLocations** array from the policy stored in the **$Policy** variable.
