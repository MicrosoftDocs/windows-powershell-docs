# Remove-WBBareMetalRecovery

## SYNOPSIS
Removes a request to include items that implement bare metal recovery from the current backup policy.

## SYNTAX

```
Remove-WBBareMetalRecovery [-Policy] <WBPolicy>
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Remove-WBBareMetalRecovery** cmdlet removes a request to include items that implement a bare metal recovery from the **WBPolicy** object that contains the current backup policy.
Depending on the contents of the **WBFileSpec** object, the backup process can still back up some items that perform a bare metal recovery, but the backup process itself may not be able to perform a bare metal recovery.

Before you can add a backup target to a **WBPolicy** object, you must put the **WBPolicy** object in edit mode.
To put the **WBPolicy** object in edit mode for a policy that you have set as the scheduled backup policy, use the Get-WBPolicy cmdlet with the **Editable** parameter.
The New-WBPolicy cmdlet creates a new **WBPolicy** object that is already in edit mode.

To use Windows ServerÂ® 2012 Backup cmdlets, you must be a member of the Administrators group or Backup Operators group.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Remove the ability to perform bare metal recovery from a backup policy
```
PS C:\> Remove-WBBareMetalRecovery -Policy $Policy
```

This command removes the setting to include bare metal recovery from the **WBPolicy** object that is stored in the variable named **$Policy**.

You cannot use the backups from this policy for bare metal recovery unless the user added all volumes that contain critical system data to the backup policy.
