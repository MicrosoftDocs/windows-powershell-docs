# Remove-WBFileSpec

## SYNOPSIS
Removes a backup file specification from a backup policy.

## SYNTAX

```
Remove-WBFileSpec [-Policy] <WBPolicy> [-FileSpec] <WBFileSpec> [-Confirm] [-WhatIf]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Remove-WBFileSpec** cmdlet removes a **WBFileSpec** object that contains a backup file specification from a **WBPolicy** object that contains a backup policy.
A backup file specification contains a list of items to include in or exclude from backups that use the backup policy.

Before you can remove a backup file specification from a **WBPolicy** object, you must put the **WBPolicy** object in edit mode.
To put the **WBPolicy** object in edit mode for a policy that you set as the scheduled backup policy, use the Get-WBPolicy cmdlet with the **-Editable** parameter.
The New-WBPolicy cmdlet creates a new **WBPolicy** object that is already in edit mode.

To use Windows ServerÂ® 2012 Backup cmdlets, you must be a member of the Administrators group or Backup Operators group.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Remove a backup file specification from a backup policy
```
PS C:\>$Filespeclist = Get-WBFileSpec -Policy $policy PS C:\>Remove-WBFileSpec -Policy $policy -FileSpec $Filespeclist[1]

None
```

This example removes a backup file specification from a backup policy.

The first command gets a list of the backup file specifications from the backup policy in the variable named **$Policy**.
The command assigns the backup file specifications to the array in the variable named **$Filespeclist**.

The second command removes the backup file specification in the first element of **$Filespeclist** from the policy in **$Policy**.
