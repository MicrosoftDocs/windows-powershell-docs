# Restore-WBCatalog

## SYNOPSIS
Recovers a backup catalog for the local computer from a storage location.

## SYNTAX

```
Restore-WBCatalog [-Force] [-BackupTarget] <WBBackupTarget>
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Restore-WBCatalog** cmdlet recovers a backup catalog for the local computer from a storage location that you specify.

If the location (disk, DVD, or remote shared folder) where you store your backups is damaged or lost and you cannot use it to restore the backup catalog, use the Remove-WBCatalog cmdlet to delete the corrupted catalog.
Then, create a new backup after the cmdlet finishes deleting your backup catalog.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Restore a backup catalog
```
PS C:\> Restore-WBCatalog -BackupTarget $Bt -Force

3 backups found in the specified target.
WARNING: The backup information on this location has details of backups created
up to 12/8/2011 11:41:38 AM. You may not be able to access backups created
after this date when the catalog recovery operation completes.
The catalog has been successfully recovered.
```

This command recovers the backup catalog from the backup target in the variable named **$Bt**.
The cmdlet displays a warning that gives details about the backups present in the backup target.
The cmdlet also displays a message that confirms that it has successfully recovered the catalog.
