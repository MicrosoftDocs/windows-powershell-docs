### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Sets the backup policy for scheduled backups.
module: WindowsServerBackup
notes: |-
  * The **WBPolicy** object must be in edit mode. To put the **WBPolicy** object in edit mode for a policy that is set as the scheduled backup policy, use the Get-WBPolicy cmdlet with the **Editable** parameter. The New-WBPolicy cmdlet creates a **WBPolicy** object in edit mode.

examples:

  code: |-
    The first command creates a backup policy object and stores it in the **$Policy** variable.
    PS C:\> $Policy = New-WBPolicy

    The second command creates a file specification object and stores the result in the **$FileSpec** variable. A file specification determines what items to include or exclude from backups.
    PS C:\>$FileSpec = New-WBFileSpec -FileSpec C:\dir1

    The third command adds a Windows Backup file specification to the backup policy.
    PS C:\>Add-WBFileSpec -Policy $Policy -FileSpec $FileSpec

    The fourth command adds bare metal recovery to the policy.
    PS C:\>Add-WBBareMetalRecovery $Policy

    The fifth command gets the Windows Backup disk configuration. This cmdlet gets the list of internal and external disks available for the local computer and stores the resulting list in the **$Disks** variable.
    PS C:\>$Disks = Get-WBDisk

    The sixth command creates a backup target object and stores it in the **$BackupLocation** variable.
    PS C:\>$BackupLocation = New-WBBackupTarget -Disk $Disks[2]

    The seventh command adds a backup target. The **$BackupLocation** variable specifies the backup locations in the policy.
    PS C:\>Add-WBBackupTarget -Policy $Policy -Target $BackupLocation 

    The eighth command sets the backup schedule in the policy. The cmdlet sets the times to create daily backups.
    PS C:\>Set-WBSchedule -Policy $Policy 09:00

    The ninth command sets the backup policy object for the computer.
    PS C:\>Set-WBPolicy -Policy $Policy

    This example sets a new backup policy.

- title: 'Example 2: Set backup policy by using a remote shared file'
  code: |-
    The first command gets the backup policy object and stores it in the **$Policy** variable.
    PS C:\>$Policy = Get-WBPolicy -Editable

    The second command creates a backup target object and stores it in the **$BackupLocation** variable. When you are prompted, specify the credentials to access the remote shared folder and acknowledge the warning about choosing a remote shared folder as a backup storage location.
    PS C:\>$BackupLocation = New-WBBackupTarget -NetworkPath \\ContosoSrv\ContosoShared

    The third command adds a backup target to the policy. The target is the **$BackupLocation** variable.
    PS C:\>Add-WBBackupTarget -Policy $policy -Target $BackupLocation 

    The fourth command sets backup policy object from the changes to the **$Policy** variable.
    PS C:\>Set-WBPolicy -Policy $Policy

    This example modifies the backup policy for the set **WBPolicy** object and changes the backup location to a remote file share.
