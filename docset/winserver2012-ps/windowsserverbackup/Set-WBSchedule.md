# Set-WBSchedule

## SYNOPSIS
Sets the current schedule for backups.

## SYNTAX

```
Set-WBSchedule [-Policy] <WBPolicy> [-Schedule] <DateTime[]>
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Set-WBSchedule** cmdlet sets the current schedule for backups and saves the settings in the **WBPolicy** object.

The **WBPolicy** object must be in edit mode.
To put the **WBPolicy** object in edit mode, use the Get-WBPolicy cmdlet with the **Editable** parameter.
The New-WBPolicy cmdlet creates a **WBPolicy** object that is already in edit mode.

To use this or any other Windows Server 2012 Backup cmdlets, you must be a member of the Administrators group or Backup Operators group.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Set a backup policy schedule
```
PS C:\>$Policy = Get-WBPolicy PS C:\> Set-WBSchedule -Policy $Policy -Schedule 12:00,09:00
```

This command sets the scheduled times to create backups and saves the information in the **WBPolicy** object.
When you set this policy on the computer, backups are created daily at the specified times.

The first command stores the result of the Get-WBPolicy in the variable named **$Policy**.

The second command sets the backup schedule in the **$Policy** variable.
The **Schedule** parameter indicates the times.
