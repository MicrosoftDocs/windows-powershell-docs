    Specifies the backup set that contains volume backup of all the system critical volumes, or contains backup of the system state for the system state recovery operation.
outputs:
- name: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    If you do not specify the **Async** parameter, the recovery operation outputs status at periodic intervals until the recovery operation completes.
    You can also call Get-WBJob to get the status of the current recovery operation.
    After completion of recovery, run Get-WBJob with the Previous parameter and an argument of 1to get the final recovery status.
syntaxes:
- >-
  Start-WBSystemStateRecovery [-BackupSet] <WBBackupSet> [[-TargetPath] <String>] [-AuthoritativeSysvolRecovery]

   [-RestartComputer] [-Async] [-Force]
- Start-WBSystemStateRecovery [-BackupSet] <WBBackupSet> [-ADIFM] [-TargetPath] <String> [-Async] [-Force]
examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Start a system state recovery operation'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>$Backup = Get-WBBackupSet PS C:\> Start-WBSystemStateRecovery -BackupSet $Backup -Force -AutoReboot -Async
  description: |-
    This example starts a system state recovery operation, then reboots the machine at the end of the recovery operation.

    The first command stores the result of Get-WBBackupSetin a variable named **$Backup**.

    The second command starts the system state recovery from the backup set in **$Backup**.
    The command also uses the **Force** parameter to perform the recovery without prompting, the **AutoReboot** parameter to reboot the machine when recovery finishes, and the **Async** parameter to suppress status output.
