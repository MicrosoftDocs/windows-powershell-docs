  The **Add-WssBackupTarget** cmdlet adds a backup target to a scheduled backup policy.
  A scheduled backup policy is a backup file specification that has a backup schedule associated with it.
  When you add a backup target to the backup policy, the backup job adds the files in the backup policy that you specify to the new target location.
