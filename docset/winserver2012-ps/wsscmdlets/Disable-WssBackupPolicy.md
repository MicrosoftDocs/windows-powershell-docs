## SYNTAX

```
Disable-WssBackupPolicy [-BackupPolicy] <ScheduledBackupPolicy> [-Force] [-PassThru] [-Confirm] [-WhatIf]

## DESCRIPTION
The **Disable-WssBackupPolicy** cmdlet disables and removes a scheduled server backup policy.
When you disable a scheduled server backup policy, the scheduled daily backups in the backup policy do not run.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Remove a scheduled server backup policy
```
PS C:\>$ContosoBUPolicy25 = Get-WssBackupPolicy PS C:\> Disable-WssBackupPolicy -BackupPolicy $ContosoBUPolicy25
```

This example disables and removes a scheduled server backup policy.

The first command gets the backup policy for the computer and stores the result in the **$ContosoBUPolicy25** variable
