    This example removes a backup target from a backup policy.

    The first command gets the current backup policies and stores them in the variable named **$ContosoBUPolicies10**.

    The second command gets the backup target for the tenth policy in the **$ContosoBUPolicies10** array, and then stores the backup target in the variable named **$ContosoBUTarget**.

    The third command removes the backup target that is stored in **$ContosoBUTarget** from the policy stored in **$ContosoBUPolicies10\[9\]**.

  The **Remove-WssBackupTarget** cmdlet removes a backup target from a scheduled backup policy.
  A scheduled backup policy is a backup file specification that has a backup schedule associated with it.
  If you remove a backup target from a scheduled backup policy, backups that use the policy no longer back up the files and volumes that the target specifies.
