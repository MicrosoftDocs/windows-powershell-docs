  description: |-
    This example removes a computer identity and any backups from the network.

    The first command uses the Get-WssComputer cmdlet to get all **DeviceInfo** objects, and then stores them in the **$DeviceList** variable.

    The second command removes a **DeviceInfo** object.
    The command uses standard array notation to specify the first element of the **$DeviceList** array as the computer to be removed.
    The command includes the **RemoveBackup** parameter.
    Therefore, the command removes any backups.

description: |-
  The **Remove-WssComputer** cmdlet removes a client computer identity, backup, and properties from the network.
  For active clients, the cmdlet removes the computer identity, but does not remove backups, unless you use the **RemoveBackup** parameter to remove associated backups.

  An archived client exists only as a backup of a computer that is no longer part of the network.
  This cmdlet removes the identity, backup, and properties for an archived client without the **RemoveBackup** parameter.
