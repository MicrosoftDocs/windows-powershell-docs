# Set-WssBackupPolicy

## SYNOPSIS
Creates or changes a scheduled backup policy.

## SYNTAX

```
Set-WssBackupPolicy [-BackupPolicy] <ScheduledBackupPolicy> [-Force] [-Confirm] [-WhatIf]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Set-WssBackupPolicy** command creates or changes a scheduled backup policy.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Specify a scheduled backup policy

PS C:\>$ContosoBUPolicy25 = Get-WssBackupPolicy PS C:\>Add-WssBackupSchedule -BackupPolicy $ContosoBUPolicy25 -BackupTime 5:00 PS C:\>Set-WssBackupPolicy -BackupPolicy $ContosoBUPolicy25
```

This example sets a scheduled backup policy as the current scheduled backup policy.

The first command gets the current backup policy for the computer and stores it in the **$ContosoBUPolicy25** variable.
