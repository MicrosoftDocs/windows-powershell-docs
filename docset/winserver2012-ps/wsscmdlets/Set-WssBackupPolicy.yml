    This example sets a scheduled backup policy as the current scheduled backup policy.

    The first command gets the current backup policy for the computer and stores it in the **$ContosoBUPolicy25** variable.

    The second command adds 5:00 A.M.
    daily as a backup schedule for the backup policy stored in **$ContosoBUPolicy25**.

    The third command sets the scheduled backup policy stored in **$ContosoBUPolicy25** (including the new schedule) as the current scheduled backup policy.
