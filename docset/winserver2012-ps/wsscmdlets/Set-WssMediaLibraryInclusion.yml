    This example excludes a shared folder from the Media Library.
    The first command uses the Get-WssMediaSharedFolder cmdlet to get the shared folders for the current server, and then stores them in the **$MediaFolders** variable.
    In this example, the server has more than one folder in the Media Library, so **$MediaFolders** contains an array.

    The second command excludes a folder from the Media Library.
    The command specifies a value of $False for the **Enable** parameter.
    The command uses standard array syntax to specify the first member of the array stored in the **$MediaFolders** variable.
