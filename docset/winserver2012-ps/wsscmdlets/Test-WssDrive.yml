    This example runs a check on a drive, and attempts to repair any file system errors.
    The first command uses the Get-WssDrive cmdlet to get a **Drive** object that has the specified GUID, and stores it in the **$Drive** variable.

    The second command runs a check on the **Drive** object stored in the **$Drive** variable.
    The command includes the **Repair** parameter, therefore the command attempts to repair any file system errors it finds.
