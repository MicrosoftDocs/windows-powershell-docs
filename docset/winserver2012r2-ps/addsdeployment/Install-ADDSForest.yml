### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Installs a new Active Directory forest configuration.
module: ADDSDeployment
notes: |-
  * By default, the DNS Server service is installed when you create a new forest. It is strongly recommended that you install and use the Windows DNS Server to support the needs for DNS name resolution in your Active Directory deployment. You do not need to specifically include the **-InstallDNS** to install it.

    If you are using Active Directory-integrated DNS, the IP address for the preferred DNS server for the first domain controller in the forest is automatically set to the loopback address of 127.0.0.1.
  This helps assure that the IP address of the first domain controller will be resolved in DNS even if the address is changed.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CreateDnsDelegation
  description: |+
    Indicates whether to create a DNS delegation that references the new DNS server that you are installing along with the domain controller.
    Valid for Active Directory-integrated DNS only.
    The default is computed automatically based on the environment.

  defaultValue: "NULL"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DatabasePath
  description: |+
    Specifies the fully qualified, non-Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path to a directory on a fixed disk of the local computer that contains the domain database, for example, C:\Databases\NTDS.
    The default is %SYSTEMROOT%\NTDS.

  defaultValue: "NULL"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DnsDelegationCredential
  description: |+
    Specifies the user name and password (account credentials) for creating DNS delegation.
    This parameter is skipped if the value for the **-CreateDnsDelegation** parameter is either specified or computed to be $false.

  defaultValue: "NULL"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="DomainMode" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainMode
  description: |+
    Specifies the domain functional level of the first domain in the creation of a new forest.
    Supported values for this parameter can be either a valid integer or a corresponding enumerated string value.
    For example, to set the domain mode level to Windows Server 2008 R2, you can specify either a value of **4** or **Win2008R2**.

    The following are the supported values: 


         -- Windows Server 2003: **2** or **Win2003**

         -- Windows Server 2008: **3** or **Win2008**

         -- Windows Server 2008 R2: **4** or **Win2008R2**

         -- Windows Server 2012: **5** or **Win2012**

         -- Windows Server 2012 R2: **6** or **Win2012R2**

    The domain functional level cannot be lower than the forest functional level, but it can be higher.
    The default is automatically computed and set.

  defaultValue: Windows2008R2
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Win2008, Win2008R2, Win2012, Win2012R2, Default
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainName
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the root (first) domain in the forest.

  defaultValue: <mandatory>
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainNetbiosName
  description: |+
    Specifies the NetBIOS name for the root domain in the new forest.
    For NetBIOS names to be valid for use with this parameter they must be single label names of 15 characters or less.

    If this parameter is set with a valid NetBIOS name value, then forest installation continues with the name specified.
    If this parameter is not set, then the default is automatically computed from the value of the **-DomainName** parameter.

    For example, if this parameter is not specified and a single-label prefix domain name of 15 characters or less is specified within the value of the **-DomainName** parameter, then promotion continues with an automatically generated NetBIOS domain name.
    For example, the prefix label "corp" within a full domain name value of "corp.contoso.com" would be a successful name choice.

    Note that if the name value given for this parameter (or if it is omitted, the value of the single-label prefix domain name within the **-DomainName** parameter) is a name of 16 characters or more, then the forest installation fails.
    For example, if a value of "CORPORATEHEADQTRS" were specified for this parameter (or if this parameter is omitted and the value of **-DomainName** were set to be "corporateheadqtrs.contoso.com") then the forest installation will fail.

  defaultValue: "NULL"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force
  description: |+
    When this parameter is specified any warnings that might normally appear during the installation of the new forest will be suppressed to allow the cmdlet to complete its operation.
    This parameter can be useful to include when scripting installation of new forests.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ForestMode" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ForestMode
  description: |+
    Specifies the forest functional level for the new forest.
    Supported values for this parameter can be either a valid integer or a corresponding enumerated string value.
    For example, to set the forest mode level to Windows Server 2008 R2, you can specify either a value of **4** or **Win2008R2**.
    The following are the supported values: 


         -- Windows Server 2003: **2** or **Win2003**

         -- Windows Server 2008: **3** or **Win2008**

         -- Windows Server 2008 R2: **4** or **Win2008R2**

         -- Windows Server 2012: **5** or **Win2012**

         -- Windows Server 2012 R2: **6** or **Win2012R2**

    The default forest functional level in Windows Server is typically the same as the version you are running.
    However, the default forest functional level in Windows Server 2008 R2 when you create a new forest is Windows Server 2003 (**2**).

  defaultValue: Windows2008R2
  position: Named

  parameterValueGroup: Win2008, Win2008R2, Win2012, Win2012R2, Default
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: InstallDns
  description: |+
    Specifies whether the DNS Server service should be installed and configured for the new forest.
    For forest installation, the default is $true (a new DNS server will be installed and configured).

  defaultValue: "NULL"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: LogPath
  description: |+
    Specifies the fully qualified, non-UNC path to a directory on a fixed disk of the local computer where the log file for this operation will be written.
    For example, C:\Logs.
    The default log file path if no other path is specified with this parameter is %SYSTEMROOT%\NTDS.

  defaultValue: "NULL"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: NoDnsOnNetwork
  description: |+
    Specifies that DNS service is not available on the network.
    This parameter is used only when the IP setting of the network adapter for this computer is not configured with the name of a DNS server for name resolution.
    It indicates that a DNS server will be installed on this computer for name resolution.
    Otherwise, the IP settings of the network adapter must first be configured with the address of a DNS server.

    Omitting this parameter (the default) indicates that the TCP/IP client settings of the network adapter on this server computer will be used to contact a DNS server.
    Therefore, if you are not specifying this parameter, ensure that TCP/IP client settings are first configured with a preferred DNS server address.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: NoRebootOnCompletion
  description: |+
    Specifies that the computer is not to be rebooted upon completion of this command.
    Omitting this parameter (the default) indicates the computer will be rebooted upon completion of the command, regardless of success or failure.
    As a general rule, Microsoft support recommends that you not use this parameter except for testing or troubleshooting purposes because once configuration has completed the server will not function correctly as either a member server or a DC until it is rebooted.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SecureString" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SafeModeAdministratorPassword
  description: |+
    Supplies the password for the administrator account when the computer is started in Safe Mode or a variant of Safe Mode, such as Directory Services Restore Mode.
    You must supply a password that meets the password complexity rules of the domain and the password cannot be blank.
    If specified with a value, the value must be a secure string.

    If this parameter is not specified, the cmdlet prompts you to enter and confirm a masked password.
    This is the preferred usage when running the cmdlet interactively.
    If additionally there are no other arguments specified with the cmdlet, you will be prompted to enter a masked password for this parameter but no confirmation of the password entered will be made (which is not recommended as it could allow a mistyped password to be configured).
    Another available advanced option is to use the **ConvertTo-SecureString** cmdlet and specify the password string inline as unmasked console input, which is also not a recommended security best practice in production deployments.

  defaultValue: <mandatory>
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SkipAutoConfigureDns
  description: |+
    Skips automatic configuration of DNS client settings, forwarders, and root hints.
    This parameter is in effect only if the DNS Server service is already installed.

  defaultValue: "NULL"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SkipPreChecks
  description: |+
    Specifies that only a base set of validations will be performed.
    This behavior is equivalent to the validations that were performed when using Dcpromo.exe in earlier versions of Windows Server to add a new forest.
    When this switch parameter is set, it specifies that additional preliminary checks should be bypassed.
    For more information on the scope of these additional preliminary checks that the ADDSDeployment module performs by default when using Windows Server 2012, refer to the table in the section "Prerequisite Checking" in the **Understand and Troubleshoot AD DS Simplified Administration in Windows Server 2012** guide (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=237244http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=237244).

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SysvolPath
  description: |+
    Specifies the fully qualified, non-UNC path to a directory on a fixed disk of the local computer where the Sysvol file will be written.
    For example, C:\Logs\SYSVOL.
    The default path if no other path is specified with this parameter is %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSVOL.

  defaultValue: "NULL"
