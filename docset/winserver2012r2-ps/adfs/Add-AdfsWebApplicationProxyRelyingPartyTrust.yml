parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AdditionalAuthenticationRules
  description: |+
    Specifies rules for additional authentication on the proxy.
    For more information about the claims language for rules, see Understanding Claim Rule Language in AD FS 2.0 & Higherhttp://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/4792.understanding-claim-rule-language-in-ad-fs-2-0-higher.aspx (http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/4792.understanding-claim-rule-language-in-ad-fs-2-0-higher.aspx) on TechNet.

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AlwaysRequireAuthentication
  description: |+
    Indicates that the proxy requires authentication for access, even if the proxy has previously authenticated credentials for access.
    Specify this parameter to require users to always supply credentials to access sensitive resources.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Identifier
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of unique identifiers.
    The proxy uses the identifiers that you specify to specify its corresponding relying party trust when it initiates sign-in requests to obtain tokens for itself.
    No other trust can use an identifier from this list.
    As common practice, you can use Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) as unique identifiers for a relying party trust, or use any string.

description: |-
  The **Add-AdfsWebApplicationProxyRelyingPartyTrust** cmdlet adds a relying party trust for Web Application Proxy.
  Authentication and authorization policies for access to internal web applications through the proxy require Web Application Proxy relying party trust.
  By default, when you deploy Web Application Proxy, a relying party trust exists.

  The Web Application Proxy relying party trust is useful to manage global network access from outside the corporate network.
  By setting authentication and authorization policies, an administrator can restrict access to internal web applications and services that are published through the Web Application Proxy.
