  name: AutoCertificateRollover
  description: |+
    Indicates whether the system manages certificates for the administrator and generates new certificates before the expiration date of current certificates.
    By default, this setting is enabled for a new instance of AD FS.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CertificateCriticalThreshold
  description: |+
    Specifies the period of time, in days, prior to the expiration of a current primary signing or decryption certificate.
    When a certificate reaches this threshold, the Federation Service initiates the automatic certificate rollover service, generates a new certificate, and promotes it as the primary certificate.
    This rollover process occurs even if the critical threshold interval does not provide sufficient time for partners to replicate the new metadata.
    Specify a short period of time that is used only in extreme conditions when the Federation Service has not been able to generate a new certificate in advance.

  defaultValue: "2"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CertificateDuration

  defaultValue: "365"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CertificateGenerationThreshold
  description: |+
    Specifies the period of time, in days, before the Federation Service generates a new primary certificate to replace the current primary certificate.
    When a certificate reaches this threshold, the Federation Service initiates an automatic certificate rollover process that generates a new certificate and adds it to the secondary collection.
    This rollover process occurs so that federation partners can consume this metadata in advance and trust is not broken when this newly generated certificate is promoted to be a primary certificate.

  defaultValue: "20"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CertificatePromotionThreshold
  description: |+

  defaultValue: "5"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CertificateRolloverInterval
  description: |+
    Specifies the certificate rollover interval, in minutes.
    This value determines the frequency at which the Federation Service initiates the rollover service by polling to check whether new certificates need to be generated.

  defaultValue: "720"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CertificateThresholdMultiplier
  description: |+
    Specifies the certificate threshold multiplier.
    By default, this parameter uses the number of minutes in a day (1440) as a multiplier.
    Change this value only if you want to use a more finely detailed measure of time, such as less than a single day, for calculating the time periods for other certificate threshold parameters.

  defaultValue: "1440"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ClientCertRevocationCheck

- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: EnableExtranetLockout
  description: |+
    Indicates whether to enable the lockout algorithm for extranet.
    When enabled, AD FS checks attributes in Active Directory for the user before validating the credential.
    If the user is determined to be in lockout state, AD FS will deny the request to the user when accessing from the extranet, to prevent random login attempts from the extranet.
    Intranet access will continue to be validated against Active Directory.
    By default, this feature is disabled in a new instance of AD FS and must be explicitly enabled by the administrator.

    Note: When this feature is enabled AD FS must be able to contact the Primary Domain Controller (PDC) of the user's domain.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: EnableKmsi
  description: |+
    Indicates whether to enable the Keep Me Signed In (KMSI) option for form-based authentication.
    KMSI is limited to providing only 24 hours of SSO.
    Note that a workplace joined device gets 7 days of SSO by default and does not need this option enabled.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: EnableLoopDetection
  description: |+
    Indicates whether to enable loop detection.
    Loops occur when a relying party continuously rejects a valid security token and redirects back to AD FS.
    The cycle terminates after 6 loops have been detected.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />

  defaultValue: "True"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ExtendedProtectionTokenCheck
  description: |+
    Specifies the level of extended protection for authentication supported by the federation server.
    Extended Protection for Authentication helps protect against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, in which an attacker intercepts a client's credentials and forwards them to a server.
    Protection against such attacks is made possible through a Channel Binding Token (CBT) which can be either required, allowed or not required by the server when establishing communications with clients.

    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Require.
    Server is fully hardened, extended protection is enforced
    - Allow.
    Server is partially hardened, extended protection is enforced where systems involved have been patched to support it
    - None.
    Server is vulnerable, extended protection is not enforced 

    The default setting is Allow.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Allow, Require, None
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ExtranetLockoutThreshold
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of bad password attempts permitted against the directory before the account is throttled when accessing applications from the extranet.
    If you use Active Directory® Domain Services account lockout policies, it is strongly recommended that you set this threshold to a value that is less than the threshold in ad_adds_3 to avoid lockout of the user inside and outside the network.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="TimeSpan" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ExtranetObservationWindow
  description: |+
    Specifies the timespan of the lockout observation window. 
    AD FS will reset a throttled state of an account when more than one observation window has expired since the last bad password attempt, as reported by Active Directory Domain Services.
    It is also possible that the last bad password field in ad_adds_3 is cleared by ad_adds_3 based on its own observation windows.
    In this case, AD FS will allow the request to be passed onto ad_adds_3 for validation.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
