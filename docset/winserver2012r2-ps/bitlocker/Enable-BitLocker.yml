  code: |-
    PS C:\> $SecureString = ConvertTo-SecureString "1234" -AsPlainText -Force
    PS C:\> Enable-BitLocker -MountPoint "C:" -EncryptionMethod Aes256 -UsedSpaceOnly -Pin $SecureString -TPMandPinProtector
  description: |-
    This example enables BitLocker for a specified drive using the TPM and a PIN for key protector.

    The first command uses the **ConvertTo-SecureString** cmdlet to create a secure string that contains a PIN and saves that string in the $SecureString variable.
    For more information about the **ConvertTo-SecureString** cmdlet, type `Get-Help ConvertTo-SecureString`.

    The second command enables BitLocker encryption for the BitLocker volume that has the drive letter C:.
    The cmdlet specifies an encryption algorithm and the PIN saved in the $SecureString variable.
    The command also specifies that this volume uses a combination of the TPM and the PIN as key protector.
    The command also specifies to encrypt the used space data on the disk, instead of the entire volume.
    When the system writes data to the volume in the future, that data is encrypted.

    This command gets all the BitLocker volumes for the current computer and passes pipes them to the Enable-BitLocker cmdlet by using the pipe operator.
    This cmdlet specifies an encryption algorithm for the volume or volumes.
    This cmdlet specifies a path to a folder where the randomly generated recovery key will be stored and indicates that these volumes use a recovery key as a key protector.

description: |-
  The **Enable-BitLocker** cmdlet enables BitLocker Drive Encryption for a volume.

  When you enable encryption, you must specify a volume and an encryption method for that volume.
  You can specify a volume by drive letter or by specifying a BitLocker volume object.
  For the encryption method, you can choose either Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithms AES-128 or AES-256, or you can use hardware encryption, if it is supported by the disk hardware.

  You must also establish a key protector.
  BitLocker uses a key protector to encrypt the volume encryption key.
  When a user accesses a BitLocker encrypted drive, such as when starting a computer, BitLocker requests the relevant key protector.
  For example, the user can enter a PIN or provide a USB drive that contains a key.
  BitLocker decrypts the encryption key and uses it to read data from the drive.
  You can use one of the following methods or combinations of methods for a key protector: 


  - Trusted Platform Module (TPM) .
  BitLocker uses the computer's TPM to protect the encryption key.
  If you select this key protector, users can access the encrypted drive as long as it is connected to the system board that hosts the TPM and system boot integrity is intact.
  In general, TPM-based protectors can only be associated to an operating system volume. 

  - TPM and Personal Identification Number (PIN) .
  BitLocker uses a combination of the TPM and a user-supplied PIN.
  A PIN is four to twenty digits or, if you allow enhanced PINs, is four to twenty letters, symbols, spaces, or numbers. 

  - TPM, PIN, and startup key.
  BitLocker uses a combination of the TPM, a user-supplied PIN, and input from of a USB memory device that contains an external key. 

  - TPM and startup key.
  BitLocker uses a combination of the TPM and input from of a USB memory device. 

  - Startup key.
  BitLocker uses input from of a USB memory device that contains the external key. 

  - Password.
  BitLocker uses a password. 

  - Recovery key.
  BitLocker uses a recovery key stored as a specified file. 

  - Recovery password.
  BitLocker uses a recovery password. 

  - Active Directory Domain Services(AD DS).
  account.
  BitLocker uses domain authentication.

  You can specify only one of these methods or combinations when you enable encryption, but you can use the **Add-BitLockerKeyProtector** cmdlet to add other protectors.

  For a password or PIN key protector, specify a secure string.
  You can use the **ConvertTo-SecureString** cmdlet to create a secure string.
  You can use secure strings in a script and still maintain confidentiality of passwords.

  This cmdlet returns a BitLocker volume object.
  If you choose recovery password as your key protector but do not specify a 48-digit recovery password, this cmdlet creates a random 48-bit recovery password.
  The cmdlet stores the password as the **RecoveryPassword** field of the **KeyProtector** attribute of the BitLocker volume object.

  If you use startup key or recovery key as part of your key protector, provide a path to store the key.
  This cmdlet stores the name of the file that contains the key in the **KeyFileName** field of the **KeyProtector** field in the BitLocker volume object.

  If you use the Enable-BitLocker cmdlet on an encrypted volume or on a volume that with encryption in process, it takes no action.
  If you use the cmdlet on a drive that has encryption paused, it resumes encryption on the volume.

  By default, this cmdlet encrypts the entire drive.
  If you use the **UsedSpaceOnly** parameter, it only encrypts the used space in the disk.
  This option can significant reduce encryption time.

  It is common practice to add a recovery password to an operating system volume by using the Add-BitLockerKeyProtector cmdlet, and then save the recovery password by using the Backup-BitLockerKeyProtector cmdlet, and then enable BitLocker for the drive.
  This procedure ensures that you have a recovery option.
