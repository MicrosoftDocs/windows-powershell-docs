# Remove-BitsTransfer

## SYNOPSIS
Cancels a Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) transfer job.

## SYNTAX

```
Remove-BitsTransfer [-BitsJob] <BitsJob[]> [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Remove-BitsTransfer** cmdlet cancels a BITS transfer job.
It deletes the underlying transfer job, removes any temporary files from the client, and deletes the associated BitsJob object.

When the **Remove-BitsTransfer** cmdlet cancels a transfer job, it deletes all the transfers.
Consider a scenario is which you are transferring three files.
One file is completely transferred, one file is pending, and one file is currently being transferred.
In this scenario, **Remove-BitsTransfer** cancels the whole transfer and deletes the underlying files.
Any files that were already transferred will not be available after you use the **Remove-BitsTransfer** cmdlet to cancel the transfer job.
Optionally, you can use a **Complete-BitsTransfer** command to commit any files that are completely downloaded and to cancel the pending and current transfers.
The transferred file  would not be deleted and would be available.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
PS C:\>Get-BitsTransfer | Remove-BitsTransfer
```

This command cancels all the BITS transfer jobs that are owned by the current user.

The output of the **Get-BitsTransfer** cmdlet is piped to the **Remove-BitsTransfer** cmdlet.
The output is a set of BitsJob objects.

### EXAMPLE 2
```
C:\PS>$b = Get-BitsTransfer -AllUsers
PS C:\>Remove-BitsTransfer -BitsJob $b
```

This command cancels all the BITS transfer jobs on the computer.

The first command retrieves all the BitsJob objects on the computer and then stores them in the $b variable.

The second command uses the **BitsJob** parameter to pass the BitsJob objects that are stored in the $b variable to the **Remove-BitsTransfer** cmdlet.

## PARAMETERS

### -BitsJob
Specifies the BITS transfer jobs to cancel.
You can pipe a value to this parameter from other cmdlets that return BitsJob objects, such as **Get-BitsTransfer**.

```yaml
Type: BitsJob[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: b

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
The cmdlet is not run.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi

Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters
This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see about_CommonParameters (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### Microsoft.BackgroundIntelligentTransfer.Management.BitsJob[]
This cmdlet accepts one or more BitsJob objects as input that populates the BitsJob parameter.

## OUTPUTS

### None
This cmdlet does not generate any output.

## NOTES
* After a job is removed (canceled) or completed, any job objects that were previously cached in variables or in scripts are no longer valid.
