  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a New-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967 or Get-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966 cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  name: Path
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the file path, or the path to a directory containing files, that will be hashed.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Recurse
  description: |+
    Specifies that hashes are created for content in subfolders.
    If you do not use this parameter, then hashes are created only for content in the top folder and no hashes are created for content in subfolders.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ReferenceFile
  description: |+
    Specifies a reference file from a previous run.
    A reference file contains a list of identifiers that describe the data in a data package.
    If a reference file is supplied, all data described in that file will be excluded from the output of this cmdlet.
    Reference files can be used to create data packages that only contain the changes from the previous time a data package was created including the target data.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: StageData
  description: |+
    Specifies that the data should be saved to a staging area for future export using the Export-BCCachePackage cmdlet.
    Use this parameter if a data package for export is being created.
    If this parameter in not specified, then hashes are generated for data, but the data is not prepared for export.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: StagingPath
  description: |+
    Specifies a temporary folder to which to output the staging data.
    If a location is not specified, then a default location on the local hard drive is used.
    Use this parameter if a large data package is being created that must be housed on a separate hard drive.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: UseVersion
  description: |+
    Specifies the version of the BranchCache hashing scheme to use.
    If version specified is `1`, then content information is generated according to the scheme used by firstref_client_7 clients.
    If version specified is `2`, then content information is generated according to the more efficient hashing scheme used by client computers that are running operating systems later than Windows® 7.

  defaultValue: None

uid: BranchCache.Publish-BCFileContent
name: Publish-BCFileContent
description: |-
  The **Publish-BCFileContent** cmdlet generates hashes, also called content information, for files in shared folders on file servers that have BranchCache enabled and the BranchCache for Network Files role service installed.

  This cmdlet is also used to stage data for the creation of a data preloading package.
  Run this cmdlet with the **StageData** parameter on one or more collections of files, then call the Export-BCCachePackage cmdlet to produce a data package containing all the staged data.
  This data package can be imported on remote hosted cache computers.
