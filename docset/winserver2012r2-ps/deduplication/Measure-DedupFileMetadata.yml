  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 

    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt. 
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes. 
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets. 
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/cimcmdlets/new-cimsession) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.

  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  The **Measure-DedupFileMetadata** cmdlet measures potential disk space on a volume.
  The DedupDistinctSize value that this cmdlet returns indicates how much disk space you can reclaim on a volume if you delete a group of folders and then run a Garbage Collection job.

  Files often have chunks that are shared across other folders.
  The deduplication engine  calculates which chunks are unique and would be deleted after the Garbage Collection job.
