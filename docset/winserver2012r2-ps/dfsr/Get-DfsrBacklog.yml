    This command retrieves the first 100 unreplicated changes between the downstream computer SRV01 and the upstream computer SRV02 for the replication group RG01 and the replicated folder RF1.
    The command also formats the output into a table that contains only the file paths and modification dates on the upstream server.

  code: |-
    PS C:\> Get-DfsrBacklog -GroupName "RG01" -FolderName "RF01" -SourceComputerName "SRV01" -DestinationComputerName "SRV02" -Verbose

    The replicated folder has a backlog of files. Replicated folder: "RF01". Count: 2400

description: |-
  The **Get-DfrsBacklog** cmdlet retrieves pending updates between two computers that participate in DFS Replication.

  Updates can be new, modified, or deleted files and folders.
  The maximum number of files that this command displays is 100.
  The **Verbose** parameter displays a count of all backlogged updates.
  Any files or folders listed in the DFS Replication backlog have not yet replicated from the source computer to the destination computer.
  This is not necessarily an indication of problems.
  A backlog indicates latency, and a backlog may be expected in your environment, depending on configuration, rate of change, network, and other factors.
