description: |-
  The **Remove-DfsReplicatedFolder** cmdlet removes replicated folders from a replication group.
  Replicated folders are logical arrangements of replication that do not contain computer-specific settings.

  When you remove a replicated folder, the DFS Replication (DSFR) service cannot replicate the folder.
  This operation does not delete any replicated file data.
  Use this cmdlet only when you decommission a replicated folder.
