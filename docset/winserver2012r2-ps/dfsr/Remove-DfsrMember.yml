description: |-
  The **Remove-DfsrMember** cmdlet removes member computers from a replication group.
  Members of a replication group host replicated folders.
  If you remove a member from its replication group, Distributed File System (DFS) Replication stops replication on that member.
  This cmdlet does not delete the contents of replicated folders or their private data.
  Use the Add-DfsrMember to add member computers to a group.
