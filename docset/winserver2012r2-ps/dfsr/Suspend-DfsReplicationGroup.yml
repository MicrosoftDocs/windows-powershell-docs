parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DestinationComputerName
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the receiving computer.
    A destination computer is also called an inbound or downstream computer.
    This computer overrides its schedule and stops inbound replication.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "2"
  aliases: ReceivingMember, RMem
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DurationInMinutes
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the number of minutes to suspend replication.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "3"
  aliases: Time
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: GroupName
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of names of replication groups.
    If you do not specify this parameter, the cmdlet queries for all participating replications groups.
    You can specify multiple groups, separated by commas.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: RG, RgName
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SourceComputerName
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the sending computer.
    A source computer is also called an outbound or upstream computer.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: SendingMember, SMem
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"

name: Suspend-DfsReplicationGroup
description: |-
  The **Suspend-DfsReplicationGroup** cmdlet suspends replication between computers, even if replication was scheduled by either a replication group or a connection.

  This cmdlet ignores the schedule for a specified number of minutes.
  This is typically preferable to altering the schedule temporarily to prevent replication, because this cmdlet does not require Active Directory replication and LDAP polling.
