  code: |-
    PS C:\>Set-DhcpServerv4Policy -ComputerName dhcpserver.contoso.com -Name DevicesPolicy -NewName TabletPolicy -Description "policy for tablet devices" -ProcessingOrder 4 -Enabled False
  description: |-
    This example renames the server level policy named DevicesPolicy to TabletPolicy, sets a description string, disables the policy, and sets the processing order to 4.

- title: EXAMPLE 2
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Set-DhcpServerv4Policy -Name PhysicalMachinesPolicy -Condition OR -MacAddress NE,00155D*,000569*
  description: |-
    This example modifies the conditions of the server level policy for non-Hyper-V clients.
    If the policy had an existing MAC address based condition, then the same condition is replaced with the condition specified in this cmdlet.
    However, if the policy had conditions based on other fields, such as the **VendorClass**, **UserClass**, **ClientId**, or **RelayAgent** parameters, then those will be retained and logically combined (ORꞌd) with the newly added MAC address based condition.

    PS C:\>Set-DhcpServerv4Policy -Name PhysicalMachinesPolicy -Condition OR -MacAddress NE,00155D*,000569* -VendorClass ""
  description: |-
    This example modifies the conditions of the server level policy for non-Hyper-V clients.
    If the policy had an existing MAC address based condition, a vendor class based policy, or both, then the conditions are replaced with the condition specified in this cmdlet.

description: |-
  The **Set-DhcpServerv4Policy** cmdlet sets the properties of an existing policy either at the server level or at the specified scope level.
  If the **CircuitId**, **ClientId**, **Fqdn**, **MACAddress**, **RelayAgent**, **RemoteId**, **SubscriberId**, **UserClass**, or **VendorClass** parameter is specified, then the conditions of the policy are being changed and this cmdlet will behave as follows:

  If the **VendorClass** parameter is specified and the policy being modified already has conditions for the **VendorClass** parameter value, then the existing **VendorClass** parameter value is removed and the new **VendorClass** parameter value will be added.

  However, if the policy being modified has conditions for the **MacAddress** parameter value, then the **MacAddress** parameter value is not altered and is logically combined (ORꞌd) or differenced (ANDꞌd) with the **VendorClass**-based conditions.

  The same applies to any of the **CircuitId**, **ClientId**, **Fqdn**, **MACAddress**, **RelayAgent**, **RemoteId**, **SubscriberId**, **UserClass**, or **VendorClass** parameters used in the conditions.
