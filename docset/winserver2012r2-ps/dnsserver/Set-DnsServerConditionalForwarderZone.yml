examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Change forwarder time-out for a zone'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Set-DnsServerConditionalForwarderZone -Name "contoso.com" -ForwarderTimeout 15
  description: |-
    This command changes the forwarder time-out for a forwarder zone named contoso.com.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 2: Change replication scope for a zone'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Set-DnsServerConditionalForwarderZone -Name "contoso.com" -ReplicationScope "Domain" -PassThru
  description: |-
    This command changes the replication scope of contoso.com to a value of Domain, which means all DNS servers in the domain.
    This example uses the **PassThru** parameter to create output.

  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a New-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967 or Get-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966 cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ComputerName
  description: |+
    Specifies a DNS server to host the forwarder.
    If you do not specify this parameter, the command runs on the local system.
    You can specify an IP address or any value that resolves to an IP address, such as a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), host name, or NETBIOS name.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Cn
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DirectoryPartitionName
  description: |+
    Specifies a directory partition on which to store the forwarder.
    Conditional forwarders are internally stored as zones.
    Use this parameter when the **ReplicationScope** parameter has a value of Custom.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ForwarderTimeout
  description: |+
    Specifies a length of time, in seconds, that a DNS server waits for the forwarder to resolve a query.
    After the DNS server tries all forwarders, it can attempt to resolve the query itself.
    The minimum value is 0.
    The maximum value is 15.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "3"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="IPAddress" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: MasterServers
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of IP addresses of the master servers of the zone.
    Conditional forwarders are stored as zones.
    You can use both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
    Specify at least one master server.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "2"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of a zone that has conditional forwarding configured.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ZoneName
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PassThru
  description: |+
    Returns an object representing the item with which you are working.
    By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ReplicationScope
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the replication scope for the conditional forwarder.
    Conditional forwarders are stored internally as zones.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Custom.
    Replicate the conditional forwarder to all DNS servers running on domain controllers enlisted in a custom directory partition.
    - Domain.
    Replicate the conditional forwarder to all DNS servers that run on domain controllers in the domain.
    - Forest.
    Replicate the conditional forwarder to all DNS servers that run on domain controllers in the forest.
    - Legacy.
    Replicate the conditional forwarder to all domain controllers in the domain.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Forest, Domain, Legacy, Custom
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: UseRecursion
  description: |+
    Specifies whether a DNS server attempts to resolve a query after the forwarder fails to resolve it.
    A value of $False prevents a DNS server from attempting resolution using other DNS servers.
    This parameter overrides the Use Recursion setting for a DNS server.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "4"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: wi
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: DnsServer.Set-DnsServerConditionalForwarderZone
name: Set-DnsServerConditionalForwarderZone
description: |-
  The **Set-DnsServerConditionalForwarderZone** cmdlet changes settings of an existing conditional forwarder on a Domain Name System (DNS) server.
  You can change the master servers, forwarder time-out, recursion, recursion scope, and directory partition name for a conditional forwarder zone.
