    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

description: |-
  The **Start-DnsServerScavenging** cmdlet notifies a Domain Name System (DNS) server to attempt a search for stale resource records.
  The successful completion of this command triggers an immediate start to a scavenge.

  Although this command to start a scavenge appears to complete successfully, the scavenge does not start unless the following preconditions are met:

  - Scavenging is enabled for both the server and the zone.
  - The zone is started.
  - The resource records have a time stamp.

  You can use the **Verbose** parameter to display all the records that the command deletes.
  You can press Ctrl + C to end a scavenge that is running on a DNS server.
  If the DNS server cannot run scavenging, the cmdlet displays the reasons why the scavenge did not start.
