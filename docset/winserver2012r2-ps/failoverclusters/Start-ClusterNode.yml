    This example forces the local node and the local cluster to start, even if quorum has not been achieved.
    If quorum has not been achieved, then the copy of the cluster configuration that is on the local node will be treated as the authoritative copy and will be replicated to all other nodes.
    This cmdlet should be considered a last resort, because some cluster configuration changes could be lost.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Cluster
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the cluster on which to run this cmdlet.
    If the input for this parameter is `.` or it is omitted, then the cmdlet runs on the local cluster.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ForceQuorum
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet forces the start of a cluster node regardless if quorum is not formed.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: fq, FixQuorum
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IgnorePersistentState
  description: |+
    Starts the cluster node without bringing resources online on the node.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ips
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="PSObject" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: InputObject
  description: |+
    Specifies the cluster node to start.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="StringCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the cluster node to start.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PreventQuorum
  description: |+
    Starts the node, but prevents it from achieving quorum and forming the cluster, to prevent a split situation with two competing instances of the cluster running.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: pq
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Wait
  description: |+
    Specifies the time in seconds to wait for the cmdlet.
    If the **Wait** parameter is not specified, then the cmdlet waits for completion.
    If `-Wait 0` is specified, then the call is initiated and the cmdlet returns without waiting.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: FailoverClusters.Start-ClusterNode
name: Start-ClusterNode
description: |-
  The **Start-ClusterNode** cmdlet starts the Cluster service on a node in a failover cluster.
  If this is the first node started, then it will wait for other nodes to join.
  The cluster will begin to run when a quorum has formed.

  This cmdlet with the **FixQuorum** parameter can be used to force quorum, that is, force the start of a cluster node even if quorum has not been achieved.
  When quorum is forced on a given node, the copy of the cluster configuration that is on that node will be treated as the authoritative copy and will be replicated to all other nodes.
  Therefore, forcing quorum should be considered a last resort, because some cluster configuration changes could be lost.
  The ability to force quorum can be especially useful in a multi-site cluster if the primary site, with the majority of nodes, becomes unavailable, and the secondary site, with a minority of nodes, need to be brought into service.
  Similarly, the ability to force quorum makes it possible to start a cluster that uses the Node and File Share Majority quorum option when none of the available cluster nodes contains a current copy of the cluster configuration.

  Note: This cmdlet cannot be run remotely without Credential Security Service Provider (CredSSP) authentication on the server computer.
