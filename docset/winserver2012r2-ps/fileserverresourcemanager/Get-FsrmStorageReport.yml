  The **Get-FsrmStorageReport** cmdlet gets one or more storage reports on the server.
  This cmdlet gets all types of storage reports: scheduled, interactive, and incident reports.
  If you do not specify the **Name** parameter, this cmdlet gets all storage reports on the server.

  The object that this cmdlet returns does not include a property to indicate if a report is interactive.
  Use the Schedule property to determine if a report is interactive or is launched by an event incident, such as a quota event.
  If the Schedule property has a value, the report is scheduled.
  If the schedule property is null, the report is interactive or generated by an event.
