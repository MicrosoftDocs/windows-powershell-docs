  The **New-FsrmFileGroup** cmdlet creates a file group object on the server.
  A file group is a logical collection of file name patterns that the server uses to define file screens and file screen exceptions.
  You can also use file group definitions for generating storage report jobs based on file type.

  The file group consists of two collections of wildcard patterns for file names.
  One collection indicates file names that the server includes for file screens, and the other collection indicates file names that the server does not include for file screens.
