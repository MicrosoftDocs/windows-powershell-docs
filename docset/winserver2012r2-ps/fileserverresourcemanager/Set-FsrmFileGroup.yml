- title: 'Example 1: Change the include pattern of a file group'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Set-FsrmFileGroup -Name "Media Files" -IncludePattern @("*.mp3", "*.wmv")
  description: |-
    This command changes the file group named "Media Files".
    After the cmdlet runs, the file group includes only files whose name ends in mp3 or wmv.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 2: Change the include pattern of a file group by using an object variable'
  code: |-
    The first command gets the file group named "Media Files" and stored the results in the variable **$Group**.
    PS C:\>$Group = Get-FsrmFileGroup "Media Files"

    The second command specifies an include pattern that includes .wma files for the file group stored in the variable **$Group**. The command stores the result in the **$list** variable.
    PS C:\>$list = $Group.IncludePattern + "*.wma"

    The third command sets the include pattern for the file group named "Media Files" to the include pattern stored in the variable **$list**.
    PS C:\>Set-FsrmFileGroup -Name "Media Files" -IncludePattern $list
  description: |-
    This example changes the file group named "Media Files".
    After the cmdlet runs, the file group also includes .wma files.
