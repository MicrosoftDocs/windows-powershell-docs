# Get-GPO

## SYNOPSIS
Gets one GPO or all the GPOs in a domain.

## SYNTAX

### ByGUID (Default)
```
Get-GPO [-Guid] <Guid> [[-Domain] <String>] [[-Server] <String>] [-All] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### ByName
```
Get-GPO [-Name] <String> [[-Domain] <String>] [[-Server] <String>] [-All] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### GetAll
```
Get-GPO [[-Domain] <String>] [[-Server] <String>] [-All] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The Get-GPO cmdlet gets one GPO or all the GPOs in a domain.
You can specify a GPO by its display name or by its globally unique identifier (GUID) to get a single GPO, or you can get all the GPOs in the domain by specifying the All parameter.

The Get-GPO cmdlet returns one or more objects that represent the requested GPOs.
By default, properties of the requested GPOs are printed to the display; however, you can also pipe the output of the Get-GPO cmdlet to other Group Policy cmdlets.

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 --------------------------
```
PS C:\> Get-GPO -name "Group Policy Test" 

DisplayName      : Group Policy Test 

DomainName       : contoso.com 

Owner            : CONTOSO\Domain Admins 

Id               : 31a09564-cd4a-4520-98fa-446a2af23b4b 

GpoStatus        : AllSettingsEnabled 

Description      : 

CreationTime     : 2/26/2009 12:15:42 AM 

ModificationTime : 2/26/2009 12:15:42 AM 

UserVersion      : AD Version: 0, SysVol Version: 0 

ComputerVersion  : AD Version: 0, SysVol Version: 0 

WmiFilter        :
```

Description

-----------

This command retrieves the "Group Policy Test" GPO.
The GPO must exist in the domain of the user that is running the session (or, for startup and shutdown scripts, the computer).
The command retrieves the GPO information by contacting the primary domain controller (PDC).

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 --------------------------
```
PS C:\> Get-GPO -Guid 31a09564-cd4a-4520-98fa-446a2af23b4b -Domain sales.contoso.com 

DisplayName      : Group Policy Test 

DomainName       : sales.contoso.com 

Owner            : SALES\Domain Admins 

Id               : 31a09564-cd4a-4520-98fa-446a2af23b4b 

GpoStatus        : AllSettingsEnabled 

Description      : 

CreationTime     : 2/26/2009 12:15:42 AM 

ModificationTime : 2/26/2009 12:15:42 AM 

UserVersion      : AD Version: 0, SysVol Version: 0 

ComputerVersion  : AD Version: 0, SysVol Version: 0 

WmiFilter        :
```

Description

-----------

This command retrieves the GPO that has the ID (GUID) 331a09564-cd4a-4520-98fa-446a2af23b4b in the sales.contoso.com domain.
If the domain of the user that is running the session (or, for startup and shutdown scripts, the computer) is different that sales.contoso.com, a trust must exist between the two domains.
The command retrieves the GPO information by contacting the PDC (in the sales.contoso.com domain).

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 --------------------------
```
PS C:\> Get-GPO -All -Domain sales.contoso.com
```

Description

-----------

This command retrieves all the GPOs in the sales.contoso.com domain.

## PARAMETERS

### -All
Retrieves all the GPOs in the domain.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Domain
Specifies the domain for this cmdlet.
You must specify the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the domain (for example: sales.contoso.com).

For the Get-GPO cmdlet, the GPO (or GPOs) to retrieve must exist in this domain.

If you do not specify the Domain parameter, the domain of the user that is running the current session is used.
(If the cmdlet is being run from a computer startup or shutdown script, the domain of the computer is used.) For more information, see the Notes section in the full Help.

If you specify a domain that is different from the domain of the user that is running the current session (or, for a startup or shutdown script, the computer), a trust must exist between that domain and the domain of the user (or the computer).

You can also refer to Domain by its built-in alias, "domainname".
For more information, see about_Aliases.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: DomainName

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Guid
Specifies the GPO to retrieve by its globally unique identifier (GUID).
The GUID uniquely identifies the GPO.

You can also refer to the Guid parameter by its built-in alias, "id".
For more information, see about_Aliases.

```yaml
Type: Guid
Parameter Sets: ByGUID
Aliases: Id

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Name
Specifies the GPO to retrieve by its display name.

The display name is not guaranteed to be unique in the domain.
If another GPO with the same display name exists in the domain an error occurs.
You can use the Guid parameter to uniquely identify a GPO.

You can also refer to the Name parameter by its built-in alias, "displayname".
For more information, see about_Aliases.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: ByName
Aliases: DisplayName

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Server
Specifies the name of the domain controller that this cmdlet contacts to complete the operation.
You can specify either the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or the host name.
For example:

FQDN: DomainController1.sales.contoso.com

Host Name: DomainController1

If you do not specify the name by using the Server parameter, the PDC emulator is contacted.

You can also refer to the Server parameter by its built-in alias, "dc".
For more information, see about_Aliases.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: DC

Required: False
Position: 2
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters
This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see about_CommonParameters (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### Microsoft.GroupPolicy.Gpo
A GPO for which to get information.
You can pipe GPO objects into this cmdlet to display information about the GPOs.
Collections that contain GPOs from different domains are not supported.

## OUTPUTS

### Microsoft.GroupPolicy.Gpo
Get-GPO returns an object that represents the requested GPO.

## NOTES
* You can use the Domain parameter to explicitly specify the domain for this cmdlet.

  If you do not explicitly specify the domain, the cmdlet uses a default domain.
The default domain is the domain that is used to access network resources by the security context under which the current session is running.
This domain is typically the domain of the user that is running the session.
For example, the domain of the user who started the session by opening Windows PowerShell from the Program Files menu, or the domain of a user that is specified in a runas command.
However, computer startup and shutdown scripts run under the context of the LocalSystem account.
The LocalSystem account is a built-in local account, and it accesses network resources under the context of the computer account.
Therefore, when this cmdlet is run from a startup or shutdown script, the default domain is the domain to which the computer is joined.

  Only one domain can be used by an instance of this cmdlet.
If you pipe a collection of GPO (Microsoft.GroupPolicy.Gpo) objects to this cmdlet, the DomainName property of the first GPO object in the collection specifies the domain for the cmdlet.
(This is because "domainname" is a built-in alias for the Domain parameter, and the Domain parameter can take its value by property name from the pipeline.) A non-terminating error occurs for any GPOs in the collection that are not in this domain.
If this domain is different from the domain of the user account (for startup or shutdown scripts, the computer account), a trust must exist between the two domains.
