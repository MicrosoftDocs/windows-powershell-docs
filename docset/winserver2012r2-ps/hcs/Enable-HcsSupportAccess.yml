  The **Enable-HcsSupportAccess** cmdlet enables access to this device for Microsoft Customer Service and Support.

  This cmdlet temporarily opens the appliance for support, and it creates an encrypted password.
  Customer Service and Support can decrypt the password to gain access to the device.
  You can retrieve that encrypted password by using the Get-HcsSupportAccess cmdlet.

  Provide the encrypted password to Customer Service and Support through email or other means.

  Share your desktop with Customer Service and Support.
  From there, you and support personnel access the appliance over the StorSimple Serial Console or remote Windows PowerShellÂ® management.

  Log on to the appliance by using serial console or remote Windows PowerShell management.
  Enter the support configuration session.
  This session allows only the following cmdlets to run: Enable-HcsSupportAccess, Disable-HcsSupportAccess, Get-HcsSupportAccess, and **Enter-HcsSupportSession**.
  After you establish the session by using your SSAdminConsole password, the **Enter-HcsSupportSession** cmdlet provides unrestricted access to the appliance.
  Customer Service and Support enters the decrypted password.
  All password input is hidden or obscured.
  After the password is validated, you receive access to the unrestricted session.
  This is an interactive session.

  Customer Service and Support accesses the system to perform troubleshooting.
  You maintain full control over the session.
  You can stop sharing your desktop with Customer Service and Support at any time.

  Finally, you turn off support access by using the **Disable-HcsSupportAccess** cmdlet.
  Disabling the support session invalidates the support password.
