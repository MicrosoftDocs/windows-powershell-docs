    Before exiting maintenance mode, ensure that any updates that are required on both 
    controllers have been applied. Failure to install on each controller could result
    in data corruption. Exiting maintenance mode will reboot both controllers, which 
    takes a few minutes to complete. Are you sure you want to exit maintenance mode?

  The **Exit-HcsMaintenanceMode** cmdlet takes a device out of maintenance mode.
  Taking a device out of maintenance mode restores I/Os and restores the connection to the azure_1 Management Portal.

  Before exiting maintenance mode, ensure that all updates are fully installed on all controllers.
  You must install maintenance mode updates on each controller individually.
  If you do not install these updates on each controller before the device enters maintenance mode, data may become corrupted.
