# Invoke-HcsSetupWizard

## SYNOPSIS
Performs initial configuration and device registration.

## SYNTAX

```
Invoke-HcsSetupWizard [-BypassValidations <Boolean>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Invoke-HcsSetupWizard** cmdlet performs initial configuration and device registration with the azure_1 StorSimple Manager Service.
This wizard configures the following settings: 

- Data0 IP address 
- Primary DNS server 
- Primary NTP server 
- Web proxy (optional) 
- Password for accessing Windows PowerShell Interface for StorSimple 
- Password for StorSimple SnapShot Manager connections
- Device registration with the StorSimple Manager Service

To register a device with the StorSimple Manager Service, you need your service registration key and service data encryption key.
For the first device that you register, the StorSimple Manager Service generates a new service data encryption key for you.
