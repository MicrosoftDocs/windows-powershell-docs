    Specifies a **PSCredential** object.
    Specify a credential that has read permission for the location that the **Path** parameter specifies.
    To obtain a **PSCredential** object, use the Get-Credentialhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=293936 cmdlet.
    For more information, type `Get-Help Get-Credential`.

  defaultValue: None

  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force

  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Path
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies a file name, including the path, to the hotfix to install.
    The hotfix must be on a share that the StorSimple device has access to.
    If the share requires credentials, they must be supplied with the **Credential** parameter.

    If you have trouble accessing a network share by specifying a name (for example, \\\\mysharehost\temp\\), try accessing it by IP address instead (for example, \\\\192.168.0.25\temp\\).
    Because this device is not joined to a domain, accessing network shares by name does not always work, depending on the configuration of your network.
    The device cannot communicate over IPSEC enabled networks.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
