### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Generates an HPC soft card certificate.
module: HPC
notes: |-
  * This cmdlet was introduced in HPC Pack 2008 R2 with Service Pack 2 (SP2). It is not available in previous versions.
  * You must enable soft card authentication on the cluster which will allow for smart card users to run jobs. To set this up, you must work with your Certificate Authentication or public key infrastructure (PKI) administrator to select or create a certificate template that must be used when generating a soft card for the cluster. The certificate template must allow for the private key to be exported, and can also have an associated access control list that defines who can use the certificate template.
