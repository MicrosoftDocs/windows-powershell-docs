### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Changes the properties for a node.
module: HPC
notes: |-
  This *DataCenter*, *Rack*, and *Chassis* parameters are deprecated as of HPC Pack 2012. Use the *Location* parameter instead.
  If you specify the *Location* parameter for a node when you run **Set-HpcNode**, the *DataCenter*, *Rack*, and *Chassis* properties of the **HpcNode** object for the node do not get set. If you specify the *DataCenter*, *Rack*, or *Chassis* parameter when you run **Set-HpcNode**, the *Location* property of the **HpcNode** object for the node is set to the equivalent location string.
  You must be a cluster administrator to run this cmdlet successfully.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Affinity
  description: |+
    Indicates how affinity is managed for tasks that run on the node.
    By default, the value is $Null, which means that affinity is managed according to the job scheduler affinity policy.
    If this property is set, node affinity overrides the job scheduler affinity settings.
    A value of 0 or $False specifies that affinity on the node is not managed by the HPC services, and the operating system or the application manages placement of tasks on physical cores.
    A value of 1 or $True specifies that the HPC Node Manager Service sets affinity for tasks (assigns tasks to specific cores).

    For more information relating to affinity, see Understanding Affinityhttp://technet.microsoft.com/library/ff919424(WS.10).aspx.

    Valid values are:

    - None
    - ComputeNode
    - BrokerNode

  name: Scheduler
  description: |+
    Specifies the host name or IP address of the head node for the cluster that includes the nodes.
    The value must be a valid computer name or IP address.
    If you do not specify the *Scheduler* parameter, this cmdlet uses the scheduler on the head node that the CCP_SCHEDULER environment variable specifies.

- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SubscribedCores
  description: |+
    Specifies the number of cores that you want the HPC job scheduler service to use when it is allocating tasks to the node.
    This value may be smaller than, or exceed the number of physical cores.
    To clear this property, set the value to $Null.
    If this value is $Null, the number of physical cores is used.

    You should ensure that the number of subscribed cores is divisible by the number of subscribed sockets.
    Therefore, each socket must have the same number of cores (for example 4 cores and 2 sockets are valid, but 10 cores and 4 sockets are not).

    This parameter was introduced in HPC Pack 2008 R2 with Service Pack 2 (SP2).
    It is not supported in previous versions.

  name: SubscribedSockets
  description: |+
    Specifies the number of sockets that the HPC job scheduler service should use when it is allocating tasks to the node.
    This value may be smaller than, or exceed the number of actual physical sockets.
    To clear this property, set the value to $Null.

    You should ensure that the number of subscribed cores is divisible by the number of subscribed sockets.
    Therefore, each socket must have the same number of cores (for example 4 cores and 2 sockets is valid, but 10 cores and 4 sockets is not).
