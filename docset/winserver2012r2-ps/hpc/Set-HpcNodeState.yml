### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Sets the state a node.
module: HPC
notes: |-
  If you set the state of a node to offline, the node can take a long time to go offline if jobs are running on the node. If any of the jobs have the Run until canceled property set, the operation to take the node offline does not return. Cancel such jobs before you set the state of the node to Offline.
  The built-in ConfirmImpact setting for this cmdlet is Medium. If this ConfirmImpact setting is equal to or higher than the value of the $ConfirmPreference variable for your environment, the cmdlet prompts for confirmation unless you specify *Confirm:$False*. If this ConfirmImpact setting is lower than the value of the $ConfirmPreference variable for your environment, the cmdlet does not prompt for confirmation unless you specify *Confirm* or *Confirm:$True*.
  You must be a cluster administrator to run this cmdlet successfully.

examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Set the state of a node'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Set-HpcNodeState -Name "MyNode" -State "Online"
  description: |-
    This command sets the state of the node named MyNode to Online.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 2: Force a node directly into Offline state'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Set-HpcNodeState -Name "MyNode02" -State "Offline" -Force
  description: |-
    This command forces the node named MyNode02 into the Offline state, without going into the draining state first.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 3: Set the state for multiple nodes'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Set-HpcNodeState -Name "MyNode03,MyNode04" -State "Offline" -Async
  description: |-
    This command sets the state for the nodes named MyNode03 and MyNode04 to Offline, and returns without waiting for the state changes to take effect.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 4: Get multiple nodes and set their state'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Get-HpcNode -GroupName "MyTestNodes" | Set-HpcNodeState -State "Offline"
  description: |-
    This command gets the **HpcNode** objects for the nodes in the node group named MyTestNodes, and sets the state for those nodes to Offline.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Async
  description: |+
    Specifies that the cmdlet should return immediately without waiting for the specified state to take effect.

    This parameter was introduced in HPC Pack 2008 R2.
    It is not supported in previous versions.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force
  description: |+
    Forces the node to go offline without going into the draining state first.
    You can only use this parameter when you specify Offline for the *State* parameter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of names of nodes for which you want to change the state.
    You cannot specify both the *Name* and *Node* parameters.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="HpcNode" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Node
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of **HpcNode** objects for the nodes for which you want to change the state.
    Use the Get-HpcNode cmdlet to get the **HpcNode** object for a node.
    You cannot specify both the *Node* and *Name* parameters.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Scheduler
  description: |+
    Specifies the host name or IP address of the head node for the cluster that includes the nodes.
    The value must be a valid computer name or IP address.
    If you do not specify the *Scheduler* parameter, this cmdlet uses the scheduler on the head node that the CCP_SCHEDULER environment variable specifies.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: State
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the new state that you want to assign to the nodes.
    Valid value are:

    - Online
    - Offline
    - Rejected

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: wi
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: HPC.Set-HpcNodeState
name: Set-HpcNodeState
