parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CommandLine
  description: |+
    Specifies the command line for the task, including the command or application name and any necessary arguments.

    In tasks that include subtasks, you can use the asterisk character as a placeholder for the parametric sweep index in Parametric Sweep tasks or for the subtask identifier in Service, Node Preparation, and Node Release tasks.
    You can include more than one asterisk to indicate the minimum number of positions to use when expressing the number of the index or subtask.
    This does not limit numbers that require more positions.
    This placeholder can be useful when defining the command or the input and output files for the task.

    The HPC job scheduler service interprets commands before it sends them to the compute nodes.
    To run a command that uses an asterisk, you can include the caret (^) as an escape character.

  description: |+
    Specifies an array of custom properties of the job.
    The list should have a format of variable_name1=value1\[;variable_name2=value2\[;...\]\].
    Custom properties are case insensitive, and will reflect the case used when they were first defined.

    This parameter was introduced in HPC Pack 2012.
    It is not available in previous versions.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Depend
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of names for the tasks in the specified job on which the new task depends.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: End
  description: |+
    Specifies the ending index for a parametric task.
    The ending index must be larger than the starting index.
    A parametric task runs the command multiple times, substituting the current index value for any asterisks in the command line.
    The current index starts at the index that the *Start* parameter specifies, and increases by the value that the *Increment* parameter specifies each subsequent time the command runs.
    When the current index exceeds the ending index, the task stops running the command.

- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Exclusive
  description: |+
    Indicates whether the job scheduler should ensure that no other task runs on the same node as this task while this task runs.

    A non-zero value or $True indicates that the job scheduler should ensure that no other task runs on the same node as this task while this task runs.
    If you specify a non-zero value or $True value for the *Exclusive* parameter for the task, you must also specify a non-zero value or $True value for the *Exclusive* parameter for the job to which you are adding the task, or the task fails on submission.

    A value of 0 or $False indicates that this task can share compute nodes with other tasks.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: FailJobOnFailure
  description: |+
    Indicates whether the task is critical for the job, so that the job and its tasks stop running and the job is marked as failed if the task fails.

    A nonzero value or $True indicates that the task is critical for the job, and that the job and its tasks stop running and the job is marked as failed if the task fails.
    A value of 0 or $False indicates that the task is not critical for the job, so that job continues to run the remaining tasks when the task that is not critical fails, and the job is marked as failed only when those remaining tasks finish.

    If you specify a value for the *FailJobOnFailureCount* parameter, and do not specify a value for the *FailJobOnFailure* parameter, *FailJobOnFailure* is automatically set to $True.

    To specify that a job and its tasks should stop running and that job should be marked as failed when any of the tasks in the job fail, use the *FailOnTaskFailure* parameter of the New-HpcJob or Set-HpcJob cmdlet.

    This parameter was introduced in HPC Pack 2008 R2 with Service Pack 1 (SP1).
    It is not supported in previous versions.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: FailJobOnFailureCount
  description: |+
    Specifies the number of subtasks of a critical parametric sweep or service task that must fail before the job and its tasks and subtask should stop running and the task and job should be marked as failed.
    You can specify a value from 1 through 1,000,000.
    If you specify more subtasks than the critical task contains, the job and its tasks and subtasks run to completion no matter how many subtasks fail.

    If you specify a value for the *FailJobOnFailureCount* parameter, but also specify $False for the *FailJobOnFailure* parameter, *FailJobOnFailureCount* is set to 0.
    If you specify a value for *FailJobOnFailureCount*, and do not specify a value for *FailJobOnFailure*, *FailJobOnFailure* is automatically set to $True.

    This parameter was introduced in HPC Pack 2008 R2 with Service Pack 1 (SP1).
    It is not supported in previous versions.

  defaultValue: None

  name: Increment
  description: |+
    Specifies the value to use when incrementing the index for a parametric task.
    This value must be a positive integer.
    A parametric task runs the command multiple times, substituting the current index value for any asterisks (*) in the command line.
    The current index starts at the index that the *Start* parameter specifies, and it increases by the value that the *Increment* parameter specifies each subsequent time the command runs.
    When the current index exceeds the index that the *End* parameter specifies, the task stops running the command.

    Specifies the overall number of cores that the task requires across the HPC cluster, in the format \[minimum-\]maximum.
    The task runs on at least the minimum number of cores and on no more than the maximum.
    If you specify only one value, this cmdlet sets the minimum and maximum number of cores to that value.
    If you specify a minimum value that exceeds the total number of cores available across the cluster, an error occurs when you submit the task or the job that contains the task.

    The minimum and maximum values can be only positive integers.

    You cannot specify the *NumCores* parameter if you also specify the *NumNodes* or *NumSockets* parameter.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Rerunnable
  description: |+
    Indicates whether the job scheduler attempts to rerun the task if the task runs and fails.

    A non-zero value or $True indicates that the job scheduler should attempt to rerun the task if the task runs and fails.

    A value of 0 or $False indicates that the job scheduler should not attempt to rerun the task if the task runs and fails, and it should move the task to the failed state immediately.

    The cluster administrator can configure the number of times that the job scheduler tries to rerun a task before moving the task to the failed state.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RunTime
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum amount of time that the task should run.
    After the task runs for this amount of time, the job scheduler cancels the task.

    You specify the amount of time in a format of \[\[days:\]hours:\]minutes.
    You can also specify "infinite" to indicate that the task can run for an unlimited amount of time.

    If you specify only one part of the days:hours:minutes format, the cmdlet interprets the specified value as the number of minutes.
    For example, 12 indicates 12 minutes.
    If you specify two parts of the format, the command interprets the left part as hours and the right part as minutes.
    For example, 10:30 indicates 10 hours and 30 minutes.

    You can use one or more digits for each part of the format.
    The maximum value for each part is 2,147,483,647.

    Specifies the host name or IP address of the head node for the cluster that includes the task that you want to modify.
    The value must be a valid computer name or IP address.
    If you do not specify the *Scheduler* parameter, this cmdlet uses the scheduler on the head node that the CCP_SCHEDULER environment variable specifies.
    To set this environment variable, run the following cmdlet:

    `Set-Content Env:CCP_SCHEDULER \<head_node_name\>`

  defaultValue: None

  name: Start
  description: |+
    Specifies the starting index for a parametric task.
    The starting index must be less than the ending index.
    A parametric task runs the command multiple times, substituting the current index value for any asterisks in the command line.
    The current index starts at the starting index, and it increases by the value that the Increment parameter specifies each subsequent time the command runs.
    When the current index exceeds the ending index that the *End* parameter specifies, the task stops running the command.
