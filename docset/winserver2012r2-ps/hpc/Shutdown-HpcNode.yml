examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Shut down the nodes in a group'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Get-HpcNode -GroupName "Old" | Shutdown-HpcNode
  description: |-
    This command gets the **HpcNode** objects for all nodes in the node group named Old and shuts down those nodes.

- title: 'Example 2: Shut down a node by name'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Shutdown-HpcNode -Name "MyComputeNode"
  description: |-
    This command shuts down the node named MyComputeNode.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Comment
  description: |+
    Specifies a comment that provides a reason that you turned off the nodes.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of the names of the nodes that you want to turn off.
    You cannot specify both the *Name* and *Node* parameters.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="HpcNode" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Node
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an array  of **HpcNode** objects that correspond to the nodes that you want to turn off.
    Use the Get-HpcNode cmdlet to get an **HpcNode** object for a node.
    You cannot specify both the *Node* and *Name* parameters.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Scheduler
  description: |+
    Specifies the host name or IP address of the head node for the cluster that includes the nodes.
    The value must be a valid computer name or IP address.
    If you do not specify the *Scheduler* parameter, this cmdlet uses the scheduler on the head node that the CCP_SCHEDULER environment variable specifies.
    To set this environment variable, run the following cmdlet:

    `Set-Content Env:CCP_SCHEDULER \<head_node_name\>`

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"

description: |-
  The **Shutdown-HpcNode** cmdlet turns off one or more nodes.
  If you do not have an Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) script that your computer vendor configured, you may not be able to start the node again remotely.
  By default, this cmdlet sends a shutdown command to the operating system, but computer vendors can change the configuration to add IPMI-based commands.
