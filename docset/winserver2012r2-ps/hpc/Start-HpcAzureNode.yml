  code: |-
    PS C:\>Get-HpcNode -GroupName "AzureNodes" -State Not-Deployed | Start-HpcAzureNode
  description: |-
    This command gets an **HpcNode** object for the Azure nodes that are in the Not-Deployed state, and then starts those Azure nodes.

  name: Scheduler
  description: |+
    Specifies the host name or IP address of the head node for the cluster that includes the Azure nodes that you want to start.
    The value must be a valid computer name or IP address.
    If you do not specify the *Scheduler* parameter, this cmdlet uses the scheduler on the head node that the CCP_SCHEDULER environment variable specifies.
    To set this environment variable, run the following cmdlet:

    `Set-Content Env:CCP_SCHEDULER \<head_node_name\>`
