### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Submits or re-queues jobs to the HPC cluster.
module: HPC
notes: |-
  * After you submit the job, the job scheduler validates the job and enters the job in the job queue. The job scheduler waits to start the job until sufficient resources become available.
  * In HPC Pack 2012 with Service Pack 1 (SP1), a cluster member added as a job operator can use this cmdlet to requeue (but not submit) a job. However, a job operator cannot modify any job properties at the time that the job is requeued.
