uid: Hyper-V.Add-VMNetworkAdapterAcl
name: Add-VMNetworkAdapterAcl
description: |-
  The **Add-VMNetworkAdapterAcl** cmdlet creates an ACL to apply to the traffic through a virtual machine network adapter.
  When a virtual network adapter is created there is no ACL on it.
  Given a list of IP-based ACL entries to be applied to traffic in the same direction, the longest match rule decides which one of the entries is most appropriate to apply to a specific packet.
