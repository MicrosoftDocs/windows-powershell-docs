## SYNOPSIS
Gets entries showing users and the virtual machines to which they can connect on one or more Hyper-V hosts.

## SYNTAX

### VMName (Default)
```
Get-VMConnectAccess [[-VMName] <String[]>] [-UserName <String[]>] [-ComputerName <String[]>]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

### VMId
```
Get-VMConnectAccess [-VMId] <Guid[]> [-UserName <String[]>] [-ComputerName <String[]>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Get-VMConnectAccess** cmdlet gets entries showing users and the virtual machines to which they can connect on one or more Hyper-V hosts.
This cmdlet is intended for use in providing other applications with the appropriate permissions required to initiate a session with the Virtual Machine Connection protocol.
Examples of such applications are Virtual Machine Manager.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```
PS C:\> Get-VMConnectAccess
```

This command gets a list of all the users who have access to connect to any virtual machine on the local computer.
The example assumes that the Grant-VMConnectAccess has been run previously for at least one user account.

### Example 2
```
PS C:\> Get-VMConnectAccess -VMName VM1
```

This command gets a list of all the users who have access to connect to virtual machine VM1.
The example assumes that the Grant-VMConnectAccess has been run previously for at least one user account for virtual machine VM1.

### Example 3
```
PS C:\> Get-VMConnectAccess -UserName CONTOSO\John
```

This command gets a list of all the virtual machines on the local computer that user Contoso\John has access to connect to.
The example assumes that the Grant-VMConnectAccess has been run previously to grant access to Contoso\John.
