  code: |-
    PS C:\>Merge-VHD -Path c:\test\Child4.vhdx -DestinationPath c:\test\Child2.vhdx
  description: |-
    This example merges the virtual hard disk from Child4 to Child2, for a virtual disk chain with Child4 as a child of Child3, Child3 as a child of Child2, Child2 as a child of Child1, and Child1 as a child of Parent, and with the virtual hard disk file for each located in c:\test.
    This example merges all data from Child4 and Child3 up to Child2.
    Child4.vhdx and Child3.vhdx are not deleted, but are no longer valid virtual hard disk files after the operation.

description: |-
  The **Merge-VHD** cmdlet merges virtual hard disks in a differencing virtual hard disk chain.
  The merge is from a specified source child disk to a specified destination child disk.

  Merge is an offline operation; the virtual hard disk chain must not be attached when merge is initiated.
