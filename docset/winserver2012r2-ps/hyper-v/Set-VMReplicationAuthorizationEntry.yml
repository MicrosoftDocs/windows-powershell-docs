  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AllowedPrimaryServer
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the allowed primary server of the authorization entry to be modified.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: AllowedPS
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: ComputerName
  description: |+
    Specifies one or more Hyper-V hosts on which the authorization entry is to be set.
    NetBIOS names, IP addresses, and fully-qualified domain names are allowable.
    The default is the local computer - use "localhost" or a dot (".") to specify the local computer explicitly.

  defaultValue: .
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PassThru
  description: |+
    Specifies that an object is to be passed through to the pipeline representing the replication authorization entry to be set.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ReplicaStorageLocation
  description: |+
    Specifies the location to store the Replica virtual hard disk files from the allowed server when a new Replica virtual machine is created.
    Modifying this location does not affect any existing virtual hard disk files on the Replica server.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "1"
  aliases: StorageLoc
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: TrustGroup
  description: |+
    Identifies a group of primary servers within which a given primary virtual machine can move so replications of the primary virtual machine are accepted by the Replica server only from primary servers that belong to the trust group.
    You can use any string to create a new trust group.
    Ensure all primary servers within a specific trust group use the same string as the value you specify for this parameter.

    Use of a trust group can help you keep virtual machines isolated by maintaining control over which primary servers are trusted to provide replication, while also allowing the virtual machines to move from one primary server to another (such as through live migration or failover from a cluster node).

  defaultValue: None
  position: "2"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="VMReplicationAuthorizationEntry" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: VMReplicationAuthorizationEntry
  isRequired: true
  description: |+

  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs. The cmdlet is not run.
