  name: ComputerName
  description: |+
    Specifies one or more Hyper-V hosts on which replication of a virtual machine is to be suspended.
    NetBIOS names, IP addresses, and fully-qualified domain names are allowable.
    The default is the local computer - use "localhost" or a dot (".") to specify the local computer explicitly.

  defaultValue: .
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PassThru
  description: |+
    Specifies that a **VMReplication** object is to be passed through to the pipeline representing the replication to be suspended.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="VMReplicationRelationshipType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ReplicationRelationshipType
  description: |+
    Specifies the replication relationship type of the virtual machine.
    Specify whether the replication relationship is a simple primary to replica or is an extended replication chain.
    The cmdlet suspends replication of the virtual machines that have the replication type that you specify.

  defaultValue: None

description: |-
  The **Suspend-VMReplication** cmdlet suspends, or pauses, replication of a virtual machine.
  To resume replication, use the Resume-VMReplication cmdlet to resume replication.
  When replication is resumed, all changes made since replication was suspended will be replicated.
