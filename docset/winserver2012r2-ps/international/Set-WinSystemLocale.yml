### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Sets the system locale (the language for non-Unicode programs) for the current computer.
module: International
notes: |-
  Please note that the System Locale setting on the computer is primarily used for legacy code page selection and font fallback. This setting is primarily used by applications that do not support Unicode. It should not be viewed from the sense of a traditional locale or culture info, and should not be confused with the user locale (Regional Format) setting.

  When changing the System Locale setting it is highly recommended to also change the Windows Display Language or UI language setting for the computer so that it matches the System Locale. In some cases, the UI language may depend on the code page and/or the font to render properly. Failure to do so can result in configurations where non-Unicode applications don't work as intended.

  The System-locale setting determines which code pages (ANSI, DOS, and Macintosh) the system uses by default.
  If you change the System-locale setting, the necessary bitmap font files are installed to support legacy applications in the selected language.
  Note that because this is a system setting, this can only be changed by a user with Administrator permissions, and changes do not take effect until the computer is restarted.
