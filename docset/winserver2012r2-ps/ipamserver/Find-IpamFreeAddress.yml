  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.

description: |-
  The **Find-IpamFreeAddress** cmdlet gets one or more free IP addresses from a range of IP addresses in IP Address Management (IPAM).
  If you specify the **NumAddress** parameter, the cmdlet returns the requested number of free IPv4 addresses.
  If you do not specify the **NumAddress** parameter, the cmdlet returns a single free IP address.
  The maximum number of free IP addresses that the cmdlet returns is 1024.
  The cmdlet does not include exclusion address ranges, reservations, and assigned addresses among the free IP addresses.
  If the requested number of free IP addresses could not be found, a warning occurs.
  If you specify the **TestReachability** parameter, IPAM returns a ping status and a DNS record status for each of the IP address that it returns.
