description: |-
  Prelaunching is a new feature added in Windows® 8.1 that improves the launch performance of apps from the Windows Store by proactively launching frequently used apps in the background if they are not already running or suspended.
  This makes starting an app as fast as switching to a suspended app from the user's perspective.
  This command enables you to prelaunch an app into debug mode.

  You identify the application to prelaunch by including the -PackageFullName and -PackageRelativeAppId parameters.

  To turn off debugging, specify the application and also include the -DisableDebugMode.
