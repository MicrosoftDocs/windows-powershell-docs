  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SelectiveSuspend
  description: |+
    Manages the selective suspend capability of the network adapter. 

    The network drive interface specification (NDIS) selective suspend interface allows NDIS to suspend an idle network adapter by transitioning the adapter to a low-power state.
    This enables the computer to reduce the power overhead on the CPU and network adapter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WakeOnMagicPacket
  description: |+
    Manages the wake on magic packet capability of the network adapter. 

    The magic packet is a broadcast frame containing anywhere within its payload `6` bytes of all `255` (`FF FF FF FF FF FF` in hexadecimal), followed by sixteen repetitions of the 48-bit MAC address of the target computer, for a total of `102` bytes.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WakeOnPattern
  description: |+
    Manages the wake on pattern capability of the network adapter. 

    A wake pattern refers to network packet filters that determine if incoming network traffic should wake the computer.
    These patterns can be enabled on the network adapter. 

    The following wake patterns may be supported by a network adapter: 

     - Wake Pattern 

     - Wake on new incoming TCP connection for IPv4 and IPv6 including TCP SYN IPv4 and TCP SYN IPv6. 

     - 802.1x re-authentication packets 

     - Bitmapped Patterns.
    Most network adapters can be programmed with bit-mapped pattern filters.
    Bitmapped patterns are defined by a bit-map mask and a pattern filter.
    As a network packet is received, it is masked using the bitmap mask and then compared to the pattern filter.
    If there is a match, then the network adapter wakes the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+

    The cmdlet is not run.
