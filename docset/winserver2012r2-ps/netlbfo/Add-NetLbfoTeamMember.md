## PARAMETERS

### -AdministrativeMode
Specifies the initial role of the new member (network adapter).

You can specify one of the following two status options:

**Active**: Allows the team member to participate in the NIC team.
By default, the initial role of the team member is Active.

**Standby**: Places the member in a standby state where it does not participate in the team.
The team member will be automatically moved to Active state if any other member of the team fails.

At most one member in a team can be in Standby mode.

The default is the current session on the local computer.
