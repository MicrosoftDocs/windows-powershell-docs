description: |-
  The **Get-DAPolicyChange** cmdlet returns the detected differences between the IP addresses (remote and local addresses) of an existing IPsec rule, and the IP addresses derived by the input parameters.
  This cmdlet also creates a Windows PowerShell® script (`.ps1`) that updates the IPsec rule end points with the retrieved IP addresses.
  The created script contains instances of the Update-NetIPsecRule cmdlet, that adds or deletes IP addresses to or from IPsec rules.

  This cmdlet is used to keep the IPsec policies for client and server refreshed in DirectAccess (DA) deployments in a double tunnel model.
  The DA first tunnel policy is defined by IP addresses that are derived from domain names and servers.
  A list of IP addresses is retrieved based on the derived values from the **Domains** or **Servers** parameter.
  This cmdlet outputs DeltaCollection objects that contain the following: the actual list of address changes detected, whether to add or delete the change in IP addresses, and a list of fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) that did not resolve.
  If there are multiple rules that match the same name, then this cmdlet fails with an error.

  Running the output script for this cmdlet (located at PSLocation) resolves the IP addresses for the DA first tunnel and updates the Group Policy Objects (GPOs) appropriately.
  The DNS server specified in the **DnsServers** parameter will be used to resolve the domain name and server names.

  By generating a Windows PowerShell script, this cmdlet allows administrators to have greater control over policy synchronization.
  The Sync-NetIPsecRule cmdlet also detects the IP address changes, but immediately updates the rules instead of returning the deviations and a `.ps1` script.
