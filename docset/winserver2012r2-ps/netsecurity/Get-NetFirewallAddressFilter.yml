examples:
- title: EXAMPLE 1
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Get-NetIPsecRule -PolicyStore ActiveStore


    This cmdlet shows the same information in a dynamically-sized, formatted table.
    PS C:\>Get-NetIPsecRule -PolicyStore ActiveStore | Format-Table
  description: |-
    This example retrieves the addresses associated with all the rules in the active store.
    Note: Running this cmdlet without specifying the policy store retrieves the persistent store.
  summary: ""
- title: EXAMPLE 2
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Get-NetFirewallRule -DisplayGroup "Core Networking" | Get-NetFirewallAddressFilter | Where-Object -FilterScript { $_.RemoteAddress -Eq "LocalSubnet6" }
  description: |-
    This example gets the address configurations associated with a particular IPsec rule.
  summary: ""
- title: EXAMPLE 3
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Get-NetFirewallRule -DisplayGroup "Core Networking" | Get-NetFirewallAddressFilter | Where-Object -FilterScript { $_.RemoteAddress -Eq "LocalSubnet6" } | Set-NetFirewallAddressFilter -RemoteAddress LocalSubnet4


    This is an alternate method with this cmdlet.
    PS C:\>Get-NetFirewallRule -DisplayGroup "Core Networking" | Get-NetFirewallAddressFilter | Where-Object -FilterScript { $_.RemoteAddress -Eq "LocalSubnet6" } | Get-NetFirewallRule | Set-NetFirewallRule -RemoteAddress LocalSubnet4
  description: |-
    This example gets the filter objects associated with the firewall rules with a particular remote, second, endpoint belonging to the Core Networking group and modifies the second endpoint of those rules.

  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

description: "The **Get-NetFirewallAddressFilter** cmdlet returns address filter objects associated with the input rules.\r\n\r\nAddress filter objects represent the local and remote addresses associated with the input rules.\r\nThe **LocalAddress** and **RemoteAddress** parameters of a single rule are represented in a separate NetFirewallAddressFilter object.\r\nThe filter-to-rule relationship is always one-to-one and is managed automatically.\r\nRule parameters associated with filters can only be queried using filter objects.\r\n\r\nThis cmdlet retrieves the addresses associated with firewall, IPsec, and IPsec main-mode rules.\r\nThis allows for rule querying based on address fields using the **LocalAddress** or **RemoteAddress** parameters; this cmdlet returns filter objects that may be further queried with the Where-Objecthttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=113423 cmdlet.\r\nThe resultant filters are passed to the Get-NetFirewallRule, Get-NetIPsecRule, or Get-NetIPsecMainModeRule cmdlet to return the rules queried by address.\r\n\r\nTo modify rule address conditions, two methods can be used starting with the address filters returned by this cmdlet and optional additional querying. \r\n                       \r\n -- The address filter objects can be piped into the Get-NetFirewallRule, Get-NetIPsecRule, or Get-NetIPsecMainModeRule cmdlet, which returns the rule objects associated with the filters.\r\nThese rules are then piped into the Set-NetFirewallRule, Set-NetIPsecRule, or Set-NetIPsecMainModeRule cmdlet where the address properties can be configured. \r\n                       \r\n -- Alternatively, piping the address filter objects directly into the Set-NetFirewallAddressFilter cmdlet allows the LocalAddress and RemoteAddress parameters of the rules to be specified."
