  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

description: |-
  The **Get-NetFirewallInterfaceFilter** cmdlet returns interface filter objects associated with the input rules.

  Interface filter objects represent the interfaces associated with firewall and IPsec rules.
  The **InterfaceAlias** parameter of a single rule is represented in a separate NetFirewallInterfaceFilter object.
  The filter to rule relationship is always one-to-one and is managed automatically.
  Rule parameters associated with filters can only be queried using filter objects.

  This cmdlet displays the interface aliases associated with firewall and IPsec rules.
  This allows for rule querying based on the InterfaceAlias parameter; this cmdlet returns filter objects that may be further queried with the Where-Objecthttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=113423 cmdlet.
  The resultant filters are passed to Get-NetFirewallRule or Get-NetIPsecRule cmdlet to return the rules queried by interface.

  To modify the interface conditions, two methods can be used starting with the interface filters returned by this cmdlet and optional additional querying.

  The array of NetFirewallInterfaceFilter objects can be piped to Get-NetFirewallRule or Get-NetIPsecrule cmdlet, which returns the rules associated with the filters.
  These rules are then piped to Set-NetFirewallRule or Set-NetIPsecrule cmdlet where the interface properties can be configured.

  Alternatively, piping the array of NetFirewallInterfaceFilter objects directly to the Set-NetFirewallInterfaceFilter cmdlet allows the **Program** and **Package** parameters of the rules to be modified.
