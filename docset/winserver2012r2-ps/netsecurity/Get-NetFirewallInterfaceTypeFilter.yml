  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

description: |-
  The **Get-NetFirewallInterfaceTypeFilter** cmdlet returns the interface type filter objects with the input rules.

  Interface type filter objects represent the interface types associated with firewall and IPsec rules.
  The **InterfaceType** parameter of a single rule is represented in a separate NetFirewallInterfaceTypeFilter object.
  The filter to rule relationship is always one-to-one and is managed automatically.
  Rule parameters associated with filters can only be queried using filter objects.

  This cmdlet displays the interface types associated with firewall and IPsec rules.
  This allows for rule querying based on the **InterfaceType** parameter value; this cmdlet returns filter objects that may be further queried with the Where-Objecthttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=113423 cmdlet.
  This cmdlet also allows the interface type filters to be obtained by InterfaceType query.
  The resultant filters are passed into the Get-NetFirewallRule or Get-NetIPsecRule cmdlet to return the rules queried by interface type.

  To modify the interface type conditions, two methods can be used starting with the interface type filters returned by this cmdlet and optional additional querying.

  The array of NetFirewallInterfaceTypeFilter objects can be piped into the Get-NetFirewallRule or Get-NetIPsecrule cmdlet, which returns the rules associated with the filters.
  These rules are then piped into the Set-NetFirewallRule or Set-NetIPsecrule cmdlet where the interface properties can be configured.

  Alternatively, piping the array of NetFirewallInterfaceTypeFilter objects directly into the Set-NetFirewallInterfaceTypeFilter cmdlet allows the **InterfaceType** parameter of the rules to be modified.
