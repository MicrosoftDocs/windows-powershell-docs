    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.

  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

description: |-
  The **Get-NetFirewallProfile** cmdlet displays the currently configured options for a specified profile.
  This cmdlet displays information that is presented on the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security Properties page, with the tabs for Domain, Private, and Public profiles.
  The specified profile can be scoped to input rules.

  To query for rules scoped to a profile, pipe the profile object into the corresponding cmdlet.
