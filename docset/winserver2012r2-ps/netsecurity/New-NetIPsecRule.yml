    This example creates an IPsec tunnel that routes traffic from a private network at `192.168.0.0/16` through an interface on the local computer at `1.1.1.1` attached to a public network to a second computer through a public interface at `2.2.2.2` to another private network at `192.157.0.0/16`.
    All traffic through the tunnel is integrity checked using ESP/SHA1, and encrypted using ESP/DES3.

description: |-
  The **New-NetIPsecRule** cmdlet creates a transport-mode or tunnel-mode IPsec rule and adds it to the target computer.
  Some parameters are used to specify the conditions that must be matched for the rule to apply, such as the **LocalAddress** and the **RemoteAddress** parameters.
  Other parameters specify the way that the connection should be secured, such as the **InboundSecurity** and the **OutboundSecurity** parameters.
  Rules that already exist can be managed with the Get-NetIPsecRule and Set-NetIPsecRule cmdlets.

  In order for custom main mode and quick mode security negotiations to occur, appropriate authorization and cryptographic sets must be associated with the rule.
  See the New-NetIPsecPhase1AuthSet, New-NetIPsecPhase2AuthSet, and New-NetIPsecQuickModeCryptoSet cmdlets for more information.

  Note: Each authentication or cryptographic set must be created in the policy store for the associated IPsec rule.
  If a particular set applies to multiple IPsec rules in different policy stores (GPOs), then the set must be duplicated for each of those stores (so that policies can be updated without linking issues).
  See the Copy-NetFirewallRule, Copy-NetIPsecMainModeCryptoSet, Copy-NetIPsecMainModeRule, Copy-NetIPsecPhase1AuthSet, Copy-NetIPsecPhase2AuthSet, and Copy-NetIPsecQuickModeCryptoSet cmdlets and this cmdlet for more information.
