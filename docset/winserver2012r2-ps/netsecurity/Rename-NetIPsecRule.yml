description: |-
  The **Rename-NetIPsecRule** cmdlet renames an existing IPsec rule.
  When creating a rule, if the **IPsecRuleName** parameter is not specified, then a randomly generated value is used.
  This cmdlet specifies a friendlier and more descriptive rule name.
  Note: The **NewName** parameter value must still be unique since it identifies a single rule object on the computer.

  This cmdlet get one or more IPsec rules to be renamed with the **IPsecRuleName** parameter (default), the **DisplayName** parameter, rule properties, or by associated filters or objects.
  The **IPsecRuleName** parameter for the queried rule is replaced by the **NewName** parameter value.
  Note: Only one IPsec rule can be renamed at a time when copying to the same policy store.
  This is because only a single IPsec rule can use the unique identifier, or name, specified by the **NewName** parameter.

  To modify the localized the **DisplayName** parameter, run the Set-NetIPsecRule cmdlet with the **NewDisplayName** parameter.

  Names are unique identifiers for rules, similar to file names.
  Each name must be unique within a given policy store.
  If rules in multiple GPOs have the same name, then one rule will overwrite the other based upon GPO precedence.
  If a rule from a GPO has the same name as a rule from the persistent store, then the rule from the GPO will overwrite the local rule.
  This can be used to create overlapping policies, where the same rule is placed in multiple GPOs, and if the rules are both applied to a computer, then the overlapping parts of the policies will only be created once.
  For this reason, two rules should only have the same name if they perform the same function.
  If the built-in local firewall rules, such as Core Networking or File & Printer Sharing rules, are copied into a domain GPO, then the domain GPO rules will override any local versions of those rules.
  However, if different GPOs specify different scopes with the same rule names, then the rules will become much harder to effectively manage.
