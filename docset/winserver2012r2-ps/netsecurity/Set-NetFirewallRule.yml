  The **Set-NetFirewallRule** cmdlet modifies existing firewall rule properties.
  This cmdlet gets one or more firewall rules to be modified with the **Name** parameter (default), the **DisplayName** parameter, or by group association using the **DisplayGroup** or **Group** parameter.
  Rules cannot be queried by property in this cmdlet, but the querying can be done by the Get-NetFirewallRule cmdlet and piped into this cmdlet.
  The remaining parameters modify the properties of the specified rules.
  If the **DisplayGroup** or **Group** parameter is specified, then all sets associated with the specified group receive the same modifications.

  To move a rule to a new GPO, copy the existing rule using the Copy-NetFirewallRule cmdlet with the **NewPolicyStore** parameter, then remove the old rule with this cmdlet.
