  code: |-
    PS C:\>$nfServiceFilter = Get-FirewallRule -DisplayName "Wireless Portable Devices" | Get-NetFirewallServiceFilter



    PS C:\>Set-NetFirewallServiceFilter -Service Any -InputObject $nfServiceFilter

  name: Service
  description: |+
    Specifies the short name of a Windows Server 2012 service to which the firewall rule applies.
    If service is not specified, then network traffic generated by any program or service matches this rule.

  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.
