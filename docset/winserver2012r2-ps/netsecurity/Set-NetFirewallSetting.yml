  name: RequireFullAuthSupport
  description: |+
    Ignores key modules that do not support all of the authentication types present in a rule.
    If this parameter is set to True, then the behavior is the same as nextref_vista and WindowsÂ® 7, that the key modules that do not support the entire authentication set will be ignored.
    If this parameter is set to False, then the keying modules will try with the subset of configured authentication types that are allowed.

  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.
