    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a New-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967 or Get-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966 cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

description: |-
  The **Show-NetIPsecRule** cmdlet displays each of the IPsec rules in the required policy store, along with the associated objects, in a clear and formatted list.

  The ActiveStore is a collection of all of the policy stores that apply to the computer so the majority of the rules output by this cmdlet using the **PolicyStore** parameter value set to ActiveStore are read-only when run on a client computer.
