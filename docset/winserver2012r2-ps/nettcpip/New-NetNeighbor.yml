  code: |-
    PS C:\>New-NetNeighbor -InterfaceIndex 12 -IPAddress "192.168.0.5" -LinkLayerAddress "00-00-12-00-00-ff"
  description: |-
    This command creates a neighbor cache entry that has the IP address 192.168.0.5.
    The command specifies that the neighbor is connected to the interface that has the index 12.
    The command specifies that the link-layer address of the neighbor cache entry is 00-00-12-00-00-ff.

- title: 'Example 2: Create an IPv6 neighbor cache entry'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>New-NetNeighbor -InterfaceIndex 13 -IPAddress "fe80::5efe:192.168.0.5"
  description: |-
    This command creates a neighbor cache entry on a virtual ISATAP interface that has the IP address fe80::5efe:192.168.0.5.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="AddressFamily" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AddressFamily
  description: |+
    Specifies the IP address family.
    The cmdlet adds a neighbor cache entry that belongs to the IP address family you specify.
    If you do not specify this parameter, the cmdlet automatically generates the address families of the neighbor cache entries.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - IPv4
    - IPv6

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: IPv4, IPv6
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    ps_cimcommon_asjob

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimSession" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a New-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967 or Get-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966 cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: InterfaceAlias
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the alias of a network interface.
    The cmdlet adds a neighbor cache entry for the network interface that has the alias you specify.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ifAlias
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: InterfaceIndex
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the alias of a network interface.
    The cmdlet adds a neighbor cache entry for the network interface located at the index you specify.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ifIndex
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IPAddress
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an IP address.
    The cmdlet adds a neighbor cache entry that has the IP address you specify.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: LinkLayerAddress
  description: |+
    Specifies the link-layer address of the neighbor cache entry.
    The cmdlet adds a neighbor cache entry that has the link-layer address you specify.

    The link-layer address is also called the media access control (MAC) address.
    A link-layer address that uses IPv4 address syntax is a tunnel technology that encapsulates packets over an IPv4 tunnel, such as Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) or Teredo.
    A link-layer address of all zeroes indicates that the neighbor is unreachable and the neighbor cache entry does not have a link-layer address entry.
    An empty link-layer address indicates that the link layer does not use link-layer addresses, such as on a loopback interface.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PolicyStore
  description: |+
    Specifies a **PolicyStore** value.
    The cmdlet adds a neighbor cache entry that has the **PolicyStore** value you specify.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - ActiveStore: The IP address information is valid. 
    - PersistentStore: The computer saves IP address information across restarts.
    When the computer restarts, it copies the saved settings to the ActiveStore. 

    Specify ActiveStore only.

    If you do not specify this parameter, the default entries are created in both the ActiveStore and the PersistentStore.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="State" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: State
  description: |+
    Specifies the state of the neighbor cache entry.
    The cmdlet adds a neighbor cache entry that has the state you specify.
    You can create only neighbor cache entries that are in a permanent state.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Permanent.
    The neighbor is statically provisioned and will not expire unless you remove it.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Unreachable, Incomplete, Probe, Delay, Stale, Reachable, Permanent
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: wi
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: NetTCPIP.New-NetNeighbor
name: New-NetNeighbor
description: |-
  The **New-NetNeighbor** cmdlet creates a neighbor cache entry.
  The neighbor cache maintains information for each on-link neighbor, including the IP address and the associated link-layer address.
  The address family that you specify for the neighbor cache entry must match the address family of the IP interface.
