  code: |-
    PS C:\> $TargetHost = New-PefTargetHost -ComputerName "Server21"
    PS C:\> $Th1p1Config = $TargetHost | Add-PefProviderConfig -Provider "Microsoft-Windows-NDIS-PacketCapture"
    PS C:\> $TraceSession01 = New-PefTraceSession -Force -Path "C:\Trace01" -SaveOnStop | Add-PefMessageSource -Source $TargetHost | Start-PefTraceSession
  description: |-
    The first command creates a target host for the computer named Server21, by using the current cmdlet, and then stores that host in the **$TargetHost** variable.
    Because this command does not specify credentials, the command uses the current credentials.

    The second command passes the host stored in **$TargetHost** to the Add-PefProviderConfig cmdlet, by using the pipeline operator.
    The command also adds a provider, and then stores the result in the **$Th1p1Config** variable.
    The Microsoft-Windows-NDIS-PacketCapture provider captures traffic at the Link Layer and above.
    Alternatively, you can use the Microsoft-PEF-WFP-MessageProvider provider to capture traffic above the IP/Network layer.

    The final command creates a session, adds the target host as the session source, and then starts the remove Live Trace Session, by using the New-PefTraceSession, Add-PefMessageSource, and Start-PefTraceSession cmdlets.
    The command stores the new session in the **$TraceSession01** variable.
    This session encapsulates the configuration settings of the previous commands in this example.

  code: |-
    PS C:\> $Credential = Get-Credential
    PS C:\> $TargetHost = New-PefTargetHost -ComputerName "Server21" -Credential $Credential
    PS C:\> $Th1p1Config = $TargetHost | Add-PefProviderConfig -Provider "Microsoft-Windows-NDIS-PacketCapture"
    PS C:\> $TraceSession01 = New-PefTraceSession -Force -Path "C:\Trace01" -SaveOnStop | Add-PefMessageSource -Source $TargetHost | Start-PefTraceSession

    This example resembles the previous example, but it also includes credentials.

    The first command creates a credential by using the Get-Credentialhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=293936 cmdlet, and stores the resulting **PSCredential** object in the **$Credential** variable.
    The **Get-Credential** cmdlet prompts you for user name and password.
    For more information, type `Get-Help Get-Credential`.

    The second command creates the target host as the computer named Server21 by using the current cmdlet, and then stores that host in the **$targetHost** variable.
    This command also specifies **$Credential** for the **Credential** parameter.

    The third and fourth commands are the same as the second and third commands of the previous example.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ComputerName
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the target host computer on which to run a Live Trace Session.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Credential
  description: |+
    Specifies credentials, as a **PSCredential** object, for the target computer specified by the **ComputerName** parameter.
    To obtain a **PSCredential** object, use the Get-Credentialhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=293936 cmdlet.
    For more information, type `Get-Help Get-Credential`.

    If you do not specify a value for this parameter, this cmdlet uses the current credentials.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "1"

uid: PEF.New-PefTargetHost
name: New-PefTargetHost
description: |-
  The **New-PefTargetHost** cmdlet creates a target host object that you specify as a target computer for remote tracing.
  You can target and add multiple computers to a Protocol Engineering Framework (PEF) Live Trace Session that you create by using this cmdlet.
  Use the object that this cmdlet creates as input to the Add-PefProviderConfig cmdlet.

  This cmdlet uses the current user credentials by default.
  Provide other credentials by specifying the **Credentials** parameter as described in Example 2.

  Note that this cmdlet enables the Microsoft-Pef-WFP-MessageProver for remote tracing.
  You can use this provider to capture remote traffic on a remote Windows 10 host only, and while running on a Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, or Windows 10 computer only.
