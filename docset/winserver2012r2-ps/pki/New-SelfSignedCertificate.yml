  description: |+
    Identifies the certificate to copy when creating a new certificate.
    The certificate being cloned can be identified by an X509 certificate or the file path in the certificate provider.
    When this parameter is used, all fields and extensions of the certificate will be inherited except the public key (a new key of the same algorithm and length will be created) and the NotAfter and NotBefore fields (the validity period for the NotBefore field is set to ten minutes in the past).

description: |-
  The **New-SelfSignedCertificate** cmdlet creates a self-signed certificate for testing purposes.
  Using the **CloneCert** parameter, a test certificate can be created based on an existing certificate with all settings copied from the original certificate except for the public key.
  A new key of the same algorithm and length will be created.

  If an existing certificate is not being cloned, then an SSL server certificate with the following default settings is created: 

   -- Subject: Empty 

   -- Key: RSA 2048 

   -- EKUs: Client Authentication and Server Authentication 

   -- Key Usage: Digital Signature, Key Encipherment (a0) 

   -- Validity Period: One year

  Delegation may be required when using this cmdlet with Windows PowerShell remoting and changing user configuration.
