examples:
- title: EXAMPLE 1
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Add-PswaAuthorizationRule -ComputerName srv2.contoso.com -UserGroupName contoso\SMAdmins -ConfigurationName PSWAEndpoint
  description: |-
    This example grants access to the session configuration PSWAEndpoint, a restricted runspace, on srv2 for users in the SMAdmins group. 
    Note: The computer name must be a fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
    Administrators define a restricted session configuration or runspace, which is a limited range of cmdlets and tasks that end users can run.
    Defining a restricted runspace can prevent users from accessing other computers that are not in the allowed Windows PowerShell® runspace, thus offering a more secure connection.
    For more information on session configurations, see about_Session_Configurationshttp://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd819508.aspx or the Windows PowerShell Web Access Helphttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=221050.

- title: EXAMPLE 2
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Add-PswaAuthorizationRule -UserName contoso\user1, contoso\user2, contoso\user3 -ComputerName srv2.contoso.com -ConfigurationName Microsoft.PowerShell
  description: |-
    This example grants access to the default Windows PowerShell session configuration, `Microsoft.PowerShell`, on srv2 for users in the users named contoso\user1, contoso\user2, and contoso\user3.
    This cmdlet creates three rules (1 per person).

  code: |-
    PS C:\> "contoso\user1","contoso\user2" | Add-pswaAuthorizationRule -ComputerName srv2.contoso.com -ConfigurationName Microsoft.PowerShell
  description: |-
    This example illustrates how to input user name values via the pipeline.

- title: EXAMPLE 4
  code: |-
    PS C:\>$o = New-Object -TypeName PSObject | Add-Member -Type NoteProperty -Name "UserName" -Value "contoso\user1" -PassThru | Add-Member -Type NoteProperty -Name "ComputerName" -Value "srv2.contoso.com" -PassThru | Add-Member -Type NoteProperty -Name "ConfigurationName" -Value "Microsoft.PowerShell" -PassThru



    PS C:\>$o | Add-PswaAuthorizationRule
  description: |-
    This example illustrates how all parameters take values from pipeline by property name.
  summary: ""
- title: EXAMPLE 5
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Add-PswaAuthorizationRule -UserName PswaServer\ChrisLocal -ComputerName srv1.contoso.com -ConfigurationName Microsoft.PowerShell
  description: |-
    This example adds a rule to allow the local user named PswaServer\ChrisLocal access to the server named srv1.contoso.com.

    This example illustrates a scenario where the gateway is in a workgroup and the destination computer is in a domain.
    The authorization rule applies to the local users on the gateway.
    On the Windows PowerShell Web Access sign-in page, to successfully authenticate, the user must provide a second set of credentials in the **Optional connection settings** area.
    The gateway server uses the additional set of credentials to authenticate the user on the destination computer, a server named srv1.contoso.com.
  summary: ""
- title: EXAMPLE 6
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Add-PswaAuthorizationRule -UserName * -ComputerName * -ConfigurationName *
  description: |-
    This example allows all users access to all endpoints on all computers.
    This essentially turns off authorization rules. 
    Note: Use of the `*` wildcard character is not recommended for security-sensitive deployments and should only be considered for test environments or used in deployments where security can be relaxed.

uid: PowerShellWebAccess.Add-PswaAuthorizationRule
name: Add-PswaAuthorizationRule
description: |-
  The **Add-PswaAuthorizationRule** cmdlet adds a new authorization rule to the Windows PowerShell® Web Access authorization rule set.

  You must specify the users, computers, and Windows PowerShell endpoints for this rule.
  You can specify both users and computers either by individual user accounts and computer names, or by specifying groups.

  For a computer that is joined to an Active Directory domain, the cmdlet uses the security identifier (SID) of the computer to create the rule.
  This allows you to use a short name, a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), or an IP address for the **Computer Name** field on the sign-in page.

  For a computer that is not joined to an Active Directory domain, the cmdlet creates the rule using the computer name provided by the administrator.
  To successfully connect to this machine, the end user must provide the computer name exactly as it appears in the rule.

  If there are multiple computers with the same name on the network, then short name can resolve to more than one computer.
  This can lead to ambiguity when establishing a connection.
  For example, if a rule exists for the workgroup computer named "Server1" and a new computer named server1.contoso.com is joined to the network, validation using the authorization rules succeeds and Windows PowerShell Web Access attempts to establish a connection to the computer named "Server1".
  It is not guaranteed that the connection is established with the specified workgroup computer; the attempt could be made on either the workgroup or the domain computer named "Server1".
  To reduce ambiguity, it is recommended that you use the FQDN for the destination computer whenever possible to create an authorization rule.

  The authorization rules evaluate the primary sign-in credential of the Windows PowerShell Web Access users, not the alternate credentials (the second set of credentials found in the Optional connection settings section of the sign-in page).
  For an example of this, see Example 6.
