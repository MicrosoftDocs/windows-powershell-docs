    The `Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure.CimInstance` object is a wrapper class that displays Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) objects.
    The path after the pound sign (`#`) provides the namespace and class name for the underlying WMI object.

    The RemoteAccessLoadBalancerNode object consists of the following properties: 

     -- The IPv4/IPv6 address or host name of the node that was added to the cluster. 

     -- The load balancing status of the node. 

     -- IPv4 address ranges configured on the node for VPN static pool address assignment.

  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a New-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967 or Get-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966 cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ComputerName
  description: |+
    Specifies the IPv4or IPv6 address, or host name of the computer, on which the Remote Access server computer specific tasks should be run.
    If this parameter is specified, then it represents the cluster to which the server is added.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Cn
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force
  description: |+
    Forces the command to run without asking for user confirmation.

    When suppressed the cmdlet assumes user confirmation for the below mentioned changes. 

     -- If self-signed NLS certificate is found on all other nodes in the cluster, then a self-signed certificate is created for this node. 

     -- If self-signed SSL (IP-HTTPS) certificate is found on all other nodes in the cluster, then a self-signed certificate is created for this node.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: InternalInterface
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the corporate network facing interface of the specified server.
    If a name is not specified, then this cmdlet attempts to find the internal interface automatically.
    For a single-network adapter configuration the same name is specified for both the internal and internet interfaces.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: InternetInterface
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the internet facing interface of the specified server.
    If a name is not specified, then this cmdlet attempts to find the internet interface automatically.
    For a single-network adapter configuration the same name is specified for both the internal and internet interfaces.

- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None

  name: VpnIPAddressRange
  description: |+
    Specifies the IP address range for allocation to VPN clients.
    This parameter must be specified if VPN is enabled.
    The range should not overlap with ranges configured on other servers in the cluster. 

    In a cluster, only static pool address assignment can be used.
    DHCP is not supported.

  defaultValue: None

  The **Add-RemoteAccessLoadBalancerNode** cmdlet adds a server to the load balanced cluster: 

   -- The server is added to the cluster to which the server on which the cmdlet is run, or to the server specified in the **ComputerName** parameter. 

   -- When a server is added to cluster, Remote Access settings are replicated on the server to match the other servers in the cluster.
  The Remote Access role and the Network Load Balancing (NLB) role should be installed on the server before adding it to the cluster. 

   -- The internal and external adapters can be specified manually.
  If no parameters are specified, then the cmdlet will attempt to detect settings automatically. 

   -- The IPv6 prefix for IP-HTTPS should be `59` bits.
  If IPv6 addressing is used for VPN, then the IPv6 prefix should be `59` bits. 

   -- All the designed IPs on the server being added to the cluster must be in the same subnet as other servers in the cluster. 

   -- If self-signed certificates are not being used, then certificates for IP-HTTPS and network location server (NLS) (if NLS is on DirectAccess (DA) Server) must be present on the new server.
  Note: The subject name of certificate must be same as the respective certificates on the other computers in the cluster.
