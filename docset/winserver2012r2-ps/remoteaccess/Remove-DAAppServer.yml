examples:
- title: EXAMPLE 1
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Remove-DAAppServer -SecurityGroupNameList daAppServerGrp
    SecurityGroupNameList: 
    GpoName  : 
    ConnectionType : E2EAuthOnlyToAppServer 
    TrafficProtection : Enabled
  description: |-
    This example deletes the daAppServerGrp SG from all GPOs.
    In current setup, daAppServerGrp was the only SG present, therefore the application server GPO (such as corp.contoso.com\DirectAccess Application Server Settings) is also removed automatically.
  summary: ""
- title: EXAMPLE 2
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Remove-DAAppServer -SecurityGroupName daAppServerGrp -Name "da-test-0807"
  description: |-
    This example deletes the computer named da-test-0807 from SG daAppServerGrp.
    The SG continues to be a part of DA Configuration.

description: "The **Remove-DAAppServer** cmdlet removes the specified list of application server security groups (SGs) from the DirectAccess (DA) deployment, removes the specified application servers from the specified DA application server SG,and removes the application server Group Policy Objects (GPOs) in the specified domains.\r\nThis cmdlet is not applicable when DA is deployed only for the management of remote clients.\r\n\r\nThe basic paradigm is that all application server GPOs always contain all SGs even if all the corresponding domains are not represented in all the SGs.\r\nThere will never be a scenario where an SG is present only in some of the GPOs.\r\nIf this happens, then it means that the configuration is in a bad state.\r\n\r\nThe application server SG and GPO parameters are treated as independent entities.\r\nA user can remove application server GPOs independent of the SGs and the domains where these SGs exist.\r\nEvery SG that is removed from the DA deployment is removed from all application server GPOs currently present. \r\n                       \r\nThe following additional capabilities of this cmdlet justify its need though AD cmdlets are already available for the deletion of SGs and GPOs. \r\n                       \r\n -- When an SG is removed it is removed in all GPOs.\r\nAdditionally, if user does not have permissions to edit a GPO the SG is not removed from any of the GPOs.\r\nWhen using the AD cmdlet user would have to carefully ensure that it is run for each of the domains and it is difficult to handle the case where he does not have permissions on some domains. \r\n                       \r\n -- With the above described paradigm there is still a need to parse an SG to remove independent application servers in the SG because every application server has a unique IP address that is used in the client policy that needs to be removed.\r\nThis functionality is handled by this cmdlet. \r\n                       \r\n -- When a GPO is removed all SGs are removed from the GPO and the application server specific policies are also removed.\r\nThe cmdlet takes care of the conditions where the GPO is removed only if it was originally created at the time of adding.\r\nIf the GPO is already present at the time of adding, then it is merely edited.\r\n\r\nApp Server configuration is a global configuration and is applicable to all DA servers in the enterprise deployment even when there is multi-site enterprise deployment.\r\n\r\nFollowing are additional behavioral notes for this cmdlet. \r\n                       \r\n -- If a nested SG has to be removed, then the cmdlet recursively parses the SG so that all servers are retrieved and policies can be removed accordingly. \r\n                       \r\n -- Removing a domain deletes the application server GPO only if it was created at the time of addition.\r\nIf it was already present, then only the DA related policies and settings are wiped out and the GPO is left intact. \r\n                       \r\n -- Deletion of all app server GPOs and SGs is a permitted operation. \r\n                       \r\n -- When removing SGs if the user does not have the permissions to configure even one app server GPO among the many that might be present, then this cmdlet terminates the processing of the entire list of SGs specified.\r\nHowever, this cmdlet still processes any GPOs that the user might have specified to remove. \r\n                       \r\n -- When removing GPOs if the user does not have the permissions to remove or configure one of the specified GPOs, then the cmdlet still proceeds with the processing of the remaining GPOs in the list."
