examples:
- title: EXAMPLE 1
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Remove-DAClient -SecurityGroupNameList 'corp.contoso.com\DirectAccessMobileClients'
  description: |-
    This example removes the DirectAccessMobileClients SG from the DA deployment.
    The use of the cmdlet to restrict users and laptops in DirectAccessMobileClients SG from accessing the corporate resources of our Contoso firm is demonstrated here.
  summary: ""
- title: EXAMPLE 2
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Remove-DAClient -DomainName "child.corp.contoso.com"
  description: |-
    This example displays the deployment that contains two domains viz.corp.contoso.com and child.corp.contoso.com and the cmdlet removes the DA client GPO in child.corp.contoso.com domain.
    This cmdlet automatically locates the client GPO in the domain and removes it.

  description: |-
    This example removes DA for firstref_client_7 client computers present in domain named child.corp.contoso.com at site 2-Edge-Site.
    This is accomplished by removing the client SG DownlevelClients which contains the Windows® 7 clients and the domain named child.corp.contoso.com.

description: "The **Remove-DAClient** cmdlet removes one or more client computer security groups (SGs) from the DirectAccess (DA) deployment, removes one or more DA client Group Policy Objects (GPOs) from domains, removes one or more SGs of down-level clients (down-level clients can connect only to the specified site) from the DA deployment in a multi-site deployment, and removes one or more down-level DA client GPOs from domains in a multi-site deployment.\r\n\r\nThe basic paradigm is that all client GPOs always point to all SGs even if the domains to which these GPOs belong are not represented in the SGs.\r\nThere will never be a scenario where an SG is present only in some of the GPOs.\r\nIf this happens, then the state of the configuration is bad.\r\nA user can remove client GPOs independent of the SGs and the domains these SGs represent.\r\nEvery SG that is removed from the DA deployment is removed in all client GPOs currently present.\r\n\r\nWhen this paradigm is extended to clients being removed from an SG we see that it is a pure SG level operation which can be accomplished using Active Directory (AD) cmdlets (such as Remove-ADGroupMember).\r\n\r\nAlthough AD cmdlets are already available for the removal of SGs and GPOs, the additional capabilities of this cmdlet are justified as follows. \r\n                       \r\n -- When an SG is removed it is removed in all GPOs.\r\nIf user does not have permissions to edit a GPO, then the SG is not removed from any of the domains.\r\nWhen using the AD cmdlet, the user would have to carefully ensure that it is run for each of the domains and it is difficult to handle the case where the user does not have permissions on some domains. \r\n                       \r\n -- When a GPO is removed all SGs in the GPO are removed and DA client specific policies are deleted.\r\nThis cmdlet takes care of the conditions where the GPO is removed at the time of deletion.\r\nIf the GPO was already present when adding it to the DA deployment, then only the DA related policies and settings are deleted and the GPO is left intact.\r\n\r\nThe following are additional behavior notes for the cmdlet. \r\n                       \r\n -- The user is not allowed to delete all client GPOs and SGs.\r\nAt least one of each should be present always. \r\n                       \r\n -- Attempting to remove SGs in even a single GPO with the correct permissions results in the cmdlet terminating the processing of the entire list of SGs that were specified.\r\nHowever, This cmdlet still processes the list of domains that the user might have specified in the cmdlet. \r\n                       \r\n -- Attempting to create, remove, or configure a client GPO in one of the specified domains without the correct permissions will result in a non-terminating error for that domain but the cmdlet proceeds with the processing of the remaining domains."
