    This example, given a DA installation in a ManageOut mode, changes the DA configuration to FullInstall mode.
    This allows remote clients to connect to resources in the corporate network over the DA connection.

    This example enables Two-factor user authentication which enables users to use certificates for DA.
    There are multiple steps involved in enabling Two-factor authentication.
    By default, PKI is disabled during DA installation and will need to be enabled.
    This is achieved by provisioning an IPsec root certificate on the DA server using this cmdlet.
    The enterprise needs to have a certification authority (CA) which will provision this certificate for all domain joint computers.
    The first two steps in this example list out the certificates present in the root certificate store of the server computer and pick an appropriate one.
    In this case it happens to be the 13th certificate in the list.
    Using this cmdlet, the certificate is then assigned as the IPsec root certificate to enable PKI and the UserAuthentication is specified to be two-factor.

    PS C:\>Set-DAServer -TeredoState Enabled
  description: |-
    This example enables clients to connect using Teredo.
    By default, Teredo is disabled unless two consecutive public IPv4 addresses are found on the internet facing interface of the server while installing DA.
    Before enabling Teredo, ensure that two consecutive public IP addresses are present.

  code: "On running the cmdlet, the user is presented with a prompt to confirm the change to the **ConnecToAddress** parameter.\r\nPS C:\\>Set-DAServer -ConnectToAddress daserverNew.com\r\nChanging the ConnectTo address will change the certificate used for IPHttps and VPN. If a load balanced cluster is deployed, change will be deployed to all servers in the cluster. Do you want to continue?\r\n\r\nOn accepting this prompt, the cmdlet tries to locate a certificate for the new connectTo address. In this case it is unable to locate one and tries to create a self-signed certificate.\r\nPS C:\\>\r\n[Y] Yes  [N] No  [S] Suspend  [?] Help  (default is \"Y\"): Y \r\n \r\nCertificate IPHttps cannot be located on the Remote Access server.

  description: |-
    This example changes the connectTo address of the DA Server.
    However, since the same address is used in IPHttps and VPN certificates, applying this changes the certificates used for both these technologies.
