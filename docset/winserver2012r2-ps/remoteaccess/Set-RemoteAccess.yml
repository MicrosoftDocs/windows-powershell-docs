    PS C:\> Set-RemoteAccess -InternalInterface 'DomainConnection' -InternetInterface 'Public Network'
  description: |-
    This example will change the internal and external interfaces configured for DA.
    Since in our example setup, DA is deployed in edge topology, the cmdlet will look for the IP configured in ConnectToAddress while installing DA and compare it with the new internet interface IP to make sure that there is a match.

  description: "Forces the command to run without asking for user confirmation.\r\n                         \r\nWhen suppressed, the cmdlet assumes user confirmation for the following conditions. \r\n                         \r\n -- Changing the interfaces: This results in re-configuration which is time consuming and the server cannot accept connections during this time.\r\n\r\n"

  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.
