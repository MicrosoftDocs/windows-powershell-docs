examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Register a scheduled task that starts a task once'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>$Sta = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "Cmd"
    PS C:\>$Stt = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Once -At 3am
    PS C:\>Register-ScheduledTask Task01 -Action $Sta -Trigger $Stt
  description: |-
    This example registers a scheduled task that starts once.

    The first command creates a scheduled task action named Cmd and assigns the **ScheduledTaskAction** object to the $Sta variable.
    The second command creates a scheduled task trigger that starts the task once at 3:00 A.M and assigns the **ScheduledTaskTrigger** object to the $Stt variable.
    The third command registers the scheduled task Task01 to run the task action named Cmd once at 3:00 A.M.
  summary: ""

  description: |-
    This example registers a scheduled task that starts every 3 days.

    PS C:\>Register-ScheduledTask Task01 -Action $Sta -Trigger $Stt
  description: |-

    The first command creates a scheduled task action named Cmd and assigns the **ScheduledTaskAction** object to the $Sta variable.
    The second command creates a scheduled task trigger that starts every other Sunday at 3:00 A.M and assigns the **ScheduledTaskTrigger** object to the $Stt variable.
    The third command registers the scheduled task Task01 to run the task action named Cmd every other Sunday at 3:00 A.M.

    PS C:\>Register-ScheduledTask Task01 -Action $Sta -Trigger $Stt
  description: |-
    This example registers a scheduled task that starts when a user logs on.

    The first command creates a scheduled task action named Cmd and assigns the **ScheduledTaskAction** object to the $Sta variable.

description: |-
  The **New-ScheduledTaskTrigger** cmdlet creates and returns a new scheduled task trigger object.

  You can use a time-based trigger or an event-based trigger to start a task.
  Time-based triggers include starting a task at a specific time or starting a task multiple times on a daily or weekly schedule.
  Event-based triggers include starting a task when the system starts up or when a user logs on to the computer.
  Each task can contain one or more triggers, which means there are many ways that you can start a task.
  If a task has multiple triggers, Task Scheduler starts the task when any of the triggers occur.
