  description: |-
    This command initiates a point in time data collection of Software Inventory Logging data and forwards the data to an aggregation server.
    To identify the aggregation server, specify the **TargetUri** parameter of the **Set-SilLogging** cmdlet.

parameters:

  name: AsJob

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CheckCollectionHistory
  description: |+
    Indicates that this cmdlet checks whether the current data set varies from the previous collection results.
    If it does vary, this cmdlet publishes a full set of the data to the aggregation server at the target uniform resource identifier (URI).
    If the data set does not vary, this cmdlet publishes a small package of data that identifies the computer to the aggregation server.

  defaultValue: None

  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a New-CimSession https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967 or Get-CimSession https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966 cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: FileName
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of a file.
    This file is used by Software Inventory Logging to define the data sources.
    Because Software Inventory Logging has an inherent default value, you do not usually need to specify this parameter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: UseCacheOnly
  description: |+
    Indicates that the server can publish stored data to the aggregation server without triggering a point in time collection of all Software Inventory Logging data.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: SoftwareInventoryLogging.Publish-SilData
name: Publish-SilData
description: |-
  The **Publish-SilData** cmdlet initiates a point in time collection of all Software Inventory Logging data, and forwards the data over the network to an aggregation server, if one is specified.
  To identify the aggregation server, specify the **TargetUri** parameter of the Set-SilLogging cmdlet.
  If Software Inventory Logging was started by an administrator by using the Start-SilLogging cmdlet, hourly collection and forwarding of data to the aggregation server commences.
  In cases where Software Inventory Logging does not receive an acknowledgement from the aggregation server that data forwarding was successfully received, the feature stores that data locally and attempts to forward both cached and current data during the next scheduled forward attempt.
  Once the cached and current data has been forwarded successfully, the feature deletes all historical data from the local server.
