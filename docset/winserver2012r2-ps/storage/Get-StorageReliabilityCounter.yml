  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a New-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967 or Get-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966 cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="CimInstance" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Disk
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the disk object for which to get storage reliability counters.
    Enter a Disk CIM object.

    Disk objects represent disks as seen by the operating system above the storage subsystem.
    Disks could be actual physical hardware directly attached to the computer, or could be virtualized storage such as a virtual disk that has been assigned to a computer and appears to the operating system as a disk.

  name: PhysicalDisk
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the physical disk object for which to get storage reliability counters.
    Enter a PhysicalDisk CIM object.

    PhysicalDisk objects represent physical disks attached to a storage subsystem and located in a storage pool.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

description: |-
  Gets the storage reliability counters for the disk or physical disk that you specify.
  These counters include information about such things as the device temperature, errors encountered, wear, and length of time the device has been in use.
