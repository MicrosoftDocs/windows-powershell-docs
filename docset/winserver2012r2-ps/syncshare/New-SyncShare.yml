    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a New-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967 or Get-CimSessionhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966 cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Description
  description: |+
    Specifies the description for a sync share configuration.
    The description is visible in Server Manager and in Windows PowerShell®, but does not appear to end users.
    The description can have a maximum of a 150 characters.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named

  name: FallbackEnterpriseID
  description: |+
    Specifies the fallback Enterprise ID that the sync share uses if it cannot successfully query Active Directory® Domain Services (nextref_adds).
    If the server cannot successfully query nextref_adds, the server uses the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the sync server as the fallback Enterprise ID unless you specify a different Enterprise ID by using this parameter.
    The Enterprise ID is issued by the Work Folders client to encrypt data on the PC or device.

    The Enterprise ID is typically constructed by querying nextref_adds for the primary SMTP address of the user, removing the username and ampersand (user@), and sending the remainder to the client as the Enterprise ID.
    For example, EvanNarvaez@Contoso.com yields the contoso.com Enterprise ID.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: InheritParentFolderPermission
  description: |+
    Indicates that the sync share inherits the permissions of the parent folder.
    If you specify this parameter, user folders inherit permissions from the parent folder of the sync share, and administrators can access the data.
    If you do not specify this parameter, by default each user is granted exclusive access to their user folder, and administrators have no access rights.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt64" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies a name for the sync share.
    The name that you specify has the following requirements: 

    - The name must be unique on the sync server
    - The name can have a maximum of 75 characters

  name: Path
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the full path of a folder on an NTFS volume to use for the sync share.
    This is the folder that acts as the parent to the user folders.
    You can specify the path with a drive letter or UNC format, but the path must be local to the server or failover cluster.
    You cannot create a sync share inside another sync share, and the path cannot contain any mount points.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "2"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RequireEncryption
  description: |+
    Indicates whether the sync server requests that the contents of Work Folders be encrypted on each PC and device that accesses the sync share.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RequirePasswordAutoLock

  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Type
  description: |+

  position: "3"
  aliases: AllowedAccount, AllowedUser
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: UserFolderName
  description: |+
    Specifies a folder-naming format for the user folder on the sync share.
    To maintain compatibility with existing user folders that use aliases for their names, specify \[user\], which is required, or omit this parameter.
    To eliminate conflicts between identical user aliases in different domains, specify \[user\]@\[domain\].
    You can also specify a relative path under the sync share root; for example, UserData\\\[user\].

    Sync share creates each user folder during the first sync operation, if it doesn't already exist.
    If the user folder exists, confirm that the user has Read/Write or Full Control permissions and is the owner of their folder, unless the folder is owned by an Administrators group.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
