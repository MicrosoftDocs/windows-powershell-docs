  The **Disable-TlsSessionTicketKey** cmdlet disables an administrator managed Transport Layer Security (TLS) session ticket key for the service account.
  The cmdlet disables the key for the TLS session by deleting the key and the corresponding rule that uses the key.

  When you disable a TLS session ticket key for the service account, the service account cannot decrypt existing TLS session tickets.
  Disabling the TLS session ticket key can affect the performance of the TLS server.
  The TLS server cannot create new session tickets and must negotiate session information between the client and the server every time the client connects to the TLS server.

  TLS creates a session ticket by using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) Session Resumption without Server-Side State mechanism \[RFC 5077\].
  This mechanism helps to improve the performance of TLS.
  The TLS server uses this mechanism to create a key to encrypt a session ticket.
  The client can later use the encrypted session ticket to resume communication with the TLS server.
  Otherwise, the client must restart the communication by acquiring a new session ticket.
  For more information, see RFC 5077, "Transport Layer Security (TLS) Session Resumption without Server-Side State."
