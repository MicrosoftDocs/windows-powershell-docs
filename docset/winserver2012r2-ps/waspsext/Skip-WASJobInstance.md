# Skip-WASJobInstance

## SYNOPSIS
Drops a computer from the running job instance.

## SYNTAX

```
Skip-WASJobInstance [-Computer] <WASComputer[]> [-JobInstance] <WASJobInstance[]> [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The Skip-WASJobInstance cmdlet drops a computer from the running job instance.
The computer is removed from the job instance but is still available.
The job instance continues to run on other computers included in the job.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```
PS C:\> $computer = get-wascomputer testcomputer-toast2
PS C:\> $instance = get-wasjob *automated* | get-wasjobinstance | where { $_.IsComplete -eq $false }
PS C:\> Skip-WASJobInstance -computer $computer -jobinstance $instance
```

This command gets the computer, and saves it as a variable.
It then gets all running job instances of jobs with "automated" in the name, and drops the computer from all running job instances.
