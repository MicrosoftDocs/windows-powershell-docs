# Get-WBPerformanceConfiguration

## SYNOPSIS
Retrieves the current volume backup performance settings.

## SYNTAX

### Volume
```
Get-WBPerformanceConfiguration [-Volume] <WBVolume> [<CommonParameters>]
```

### OverallSetting
```
Get-WBPerformanceConfiguration [-OverallPerformanceSetting] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Get-WBPerformanceSetting** cmdlet retrieves the current performance settings for volume backups.
The settings are applicable only for volume backups; these settings are not applicable for files, folders, system state, or applications.
The settings apply globally to all volumes in a backup, or to specific volumes.
The valid settings are: 


- AlwaysFull:  The time to create a backup is proportional to the size of volume being backed up.
This setting applies at a global level for all volumes or for specific volumes. 


- AlwaysIncremental:  Increase the backup speed by just tracking the changes between the last and current backup.
This option is not recommended for servers with disk-intensive operation which may experience reduced disk throughput on volumes included in the backup.
This can be set at a global level for all volumes or specific for some volumes. 


- Custom:  This is the global setting reported in case there is a specific volume level setting set.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1:Retrieve global settings
```
PS C:\> Get-WBPerformanceConfiguration -OverallPerformanceSetting AlwaysIncremental
```

This example retrieves the global settings for all volumes with the AlwaysIncremental setting.

### Example 2: Retrieve settings for a volume
```
PS C:\> $Backup = Get-WBBackupSet
PS C:\> Get-WBPerformanceConfiguration -Volume $Backup.Volume[1] AlwaysFull
```

This example retrieves the settings for a specific volume with the AlwaysFull setting.
