# Get-WBSystemState

## SYNOPSIS
Gets a Boolean value that indicates whether system state recovery was added to the backup policy.

## SYNTAX

```
Get-WBSystemState [-Policy] <WBPolicy> [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Get-WBSystemState** cmdlet gets a Boolean value that indicates whether the ability to perform system state recoveries along with the backups was added to the **WBPolicy** object.
If the system state is not in the list of items to be backed up, use the Add-WBSystemState cmdlet to add it to the list.

To use this cmdlet, you must be a member of the Administrators group or Backup Operators group.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Get the system state setting from the backup
```
PS C:\> $Policy = Get-WBPolicy
PS C:\> Get-WBSystemState -Policy $Policy
```

This example displays a Boolean value that indicates whether the system state setting was added to the **WBPolicy** object **$Policy**.
The system state setting enables you to use the backups to perform system state recoveries.

The first command stores the result of the **Get-WBPolicy** cmdlet to the variable named **$Policy**

The second command displays the result of the **Get-WBSystemState** cmdlet using the variable named **$Policy**.
