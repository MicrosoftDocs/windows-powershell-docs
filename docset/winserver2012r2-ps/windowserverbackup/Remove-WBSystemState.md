# Remove-WBSystemState

## SYNOPSIS
Removes the system state components from the backup policy.

## SYNTAX

```
Remove-WBSystemState [-Policy] <WBPolicy> [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Remove-WBSystemState** cmdlet removes the system state components from a policy contained in the **WBPolicy** object.
Depending on what the **WBPolicy** object includes, you may still backup some of the components that are part of the system state, but you may not be able to use the components in a system state recovery.

The **WBPolicy** object must be in edit mode.
To put the **WBPolicy** object in edit mode for a policy that is the scheduled backup policy, use the Get-WBPolicy cmdlet with the **Editable** parameter.
The New-WBPolicy cmdlet creates a new **WBPolicy** object that is already in edit mode.

To use this cmdlet, you must be a member of the Administrators group or Backup Operators group.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Remove system state from the backup policy
```
PS C:\> $Policy = Get-WBPolicy
PS C:\> Remove-WBSystemState -Policy $Policy
```

This example removes the system state components from the **WBPolicy** object.

The first command stores the results of the Get-WBPolicy cmdlet in the variable named **$Policy**.

The second command removes system state components from the backup policy in the variable **$Policy**.
