  The **Get-WssClientBmrMediaGenerationJob** cmdlet gets the client full system restore media generation job status.
  A full system restore recovers the operating system from a backup, and is also called bare metal recovery (BMR).
  The status includes: 

  - Status.
  The current status of the job.
  - LastStage.
  The last status of the job.
  - Result.
  The job run result.
  - BootableMediaPath.
  The path to the bootable media.

  The status also checks if the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) image exists, if the Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK) is ready, if the restore image is ready, if the media is ready, and if the Windows Deployment Services (WDS) image is deployed.
