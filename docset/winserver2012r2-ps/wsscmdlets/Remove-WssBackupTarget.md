# Remove-WssBackupTarget

## SYNOPSIS
Removes a backup target from a scheduled backup policy.

## SYNTAX

```
Remove-WssBackupTarget [-BackupPolicy] <ScheduledBackupPolicy> [-BackupTarget] <BackupTarget>
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Remove-WssBackupTarget** cmdlet removes a backup target from a scheduled backup policy.
A scheduled backup policy is a backup file specification that has a backup schedule associated with it.
If you remove a backup target from a scheduled backup policy, backups that use the policy no longer back up the files and volumes that the target specifies.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Remove a backup target from a policy
```
PS C:\>$ContosoBUPolicies10 = Get-WSSBackupPolicy
PS C:\> $ContosoBUTarget = Get-WssBackupTarget -BackupPolicy $ContosoBUPolicies10[9]
PS C:\> Remove-WssBackupTarget -BackupPolicy $ContosoBUPolicy10[9] -BackupTarget $ContosoBUTarget
```

This example removes a backup target from a backup policy.

The first command gets the current backup policies and stores them in the **$ContosoBUPolicies10** variable.

The second command gets the backup target for the tenth policy in the **$ContosoBUPolicies10** array, and then stores the backup target in the **$ContosoBUTarget** variable.

The third command removes the backup target that is stored in **$ContosoBUTarget** from the policy stored in **$ContosoBUPolicies10\[9\]**.
