  The **Remove-WssMsoGroup** cmdlet removes a Windows aad_1 security group that is assigned to a Windows Server Essentials user group.
  This cmdlet removes both the assignment and the security group itself from aad_2.
  To remove just the assignment, use the Remove-WssMsoGroupAssignment cmdlet.
  If the group that is specified is not assigned to a Windows Server Essentials user group, no error is generated, but nothing is done to the group.
