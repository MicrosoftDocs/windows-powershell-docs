### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Enables an Active Directory optional feature.
module: ActiveDirectory
notes: |-
  * This cmdlet does not work with an Active Directory snapshot.
  * This cmdlet does not work with a read-only domain controller.
  * Recycle Bin Feature: Once the Active Directory Recycle Bin is enabled, all objects deleted before the Active Directory Recycle Bin was enabled (tombstone objects) become recycled objects. They are no longer visible in the Deleted Objects container and they cannot be recovered using Active Directory Recycle Bin. The only way to restore these objects is through an authoritative restore from an AD DS backup taken before the Active Directory Recycle Bin was enabled.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="ADAuthType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AuthType
  description: |+
    Specifies the authentication method to use.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Negotiate or 0
    - Basic or 1

    The default authentication method is Negotiate.

    A Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection is required for the Basic authentication method.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Negotiate, Basic
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Credential
  description: |+
    Specifies the user account credentials to use to perform this task.
    The default credentials are the credentials of the currently logged on user unless the cmdlet is run from an Active Directory module for Windows PowerShell provider drive.
    If the cmdlet is run from such a provider drive, the account associated with the drive is the default.

    To specify this parameter, you can type a user name, such as User1 or Domain01\User01 or you can specify a **PSCredential** object.
    If you specify a user name for this parameter, the cmdlet prompts for a password.

    You can also create a **PSCredential** object by using a script or by using the **Get-Credential** cmdlet.
    You can then set the *Credential* parameter to the **PSCredential** object.

    If the acting credentials do not have directory-level permission to perform the task, Active Directory module for Windows PowerShell returns a terminating error.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ADOptionalFeature" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an Active Directory optional feature object by providing one of the following values.
    The identifier in parentheses is the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) display name for the attribute.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - A FQDN
    - A feature GUID (featureGUID)
    - An object GUID (objectGUID)

    The cmdlet searches the default naming context or partition to find the object.
    If two or more objects are found, the cmdlet returns a non-terminating error.

    This parameter can also get this object through the pipeline or you can set this parameter to an optional feature object instance.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PassThru
  description: |+
    Returns an object representing the item with which you are working.
    By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ADOptionalFeatureScope" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Scope
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the scope at which the feature is enabled or disabled.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Domain or 0
    - Forest or 1

  defaultValue: None
  position: "2"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Unknown, ForestOrConfigurationSet, Domain
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Server
  description: |+
    Specifies the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) instance to connect to, by providing one of the following values for a corresponding domain name or directory server.
    The service may be any of the following: Active Directory Lightweight Domain Services (AD LDS), AD DS, or Active Directory snapshot instance.

    Specify the AD DS instance in one of the following ways:  

    Domain name values:

    - FQDN
    - NetBIOS name

    Directory server values:  

    - Fully qualified directory server name
    - NetBIOS name
    - Fully qualified directory server name and port

    The default value for this parameter is determined by one of the following methods in the order that they are listed:

    - By using the **Server** value from objects passed through the pipeline
    - By using the server information associated with the AD DS Windows PowerShell provider drive, when the cmdlet runs in that drive
    - By using the domain of the computer running Windows PowerShell

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ADEntity" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Target
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the domain or forest in which to modify the optional feature.
    You can identify the target domain or forest by providing one of the following values: 

    - FQDN of the forest or domain
    - NetBIOS name of the forest or domain

    You can also, where *Scope* is set to domain (not forest), use the following: 

    - Distinguished name of the domain naming context

  defaultValue: None

    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: wi
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: ActiveDirectory.Enable-ADOptionalFeature
name: Enable-ADOptionalFeature
description: |-
  The **Enable-ADOptionalFeature** cmdlet enables an Active Directory optional feature that is associated with a particular domain mode or forest mode.
  Active Directory optional features that depend on a specified domain mode or forest mode must be explicitly enabled after the domain mode or forest mode is set.

  The *Identity* parameter specifies the Active Directory optional feature that you want to enable.
  You can identify an optional feature by its distinguished name, feature GUID, or object GUID.
  You can also set the parameter to an optional feature object variable, such as `$<localOptionalFeatureObject>` or you can pass an optional feature object through the pipeline to the *Identity* parameter.
  For example, you can use the **Get-ADOptionalFeature** cmdlet to retrieve an optional feature object and then pass the object through the pipeline to the **Enable-ADOptionalFeature** cmdlet.

  The *Scope* parameter specifies the scope at which the optional feature is enabled.

  The *Target* parameter specifies the domain or forest on which the optional feature is enabled.
  You can identify the domain or forest by its fully-qualified domain name (FQDN), NetBIOS name, or distinguished name of the domain naming context.
