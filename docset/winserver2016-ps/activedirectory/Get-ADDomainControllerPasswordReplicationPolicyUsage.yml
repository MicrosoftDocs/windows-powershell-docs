parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AuthenticatedAccounts
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies a search for accounts that have been authenticated by a read-only domain controller.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ADAuthType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AuthType
  description: |+
    Specifies the authentication method to use.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Negotiate or 0
    - Basic or 1

    The default authentication method is Negotiate.

    A Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection is required for the Basic authentication method.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Negotiate, Basic
- type: <xref href="PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Credential
  description: |+
    Specifies the user account credentials to use to perform this task.
    The default credentials are the credentials of the currently logged on user unless the cmdlet is run from an Active Directory module for Windows PowerShell provider drive.
    If the cmdlet is run from such a provider drive, the account associated with the drive is the default.

    Specifies the credentials for the security context under which the task is performed.
    If this security context doesn't have directory level permissions to perform the task, then an error is returned by the directory.
    If running under the context of an Active Directory module for Windows PowerShell provider drive, the credentials information associated with the drive is used as the default value; otherwise, the currently logged on user security context is used.

    To specify this parameter, you can type a user name, such as User1 or Domain01\User01 or you can specify a **PSCredential** object.
    If you specify a user name for this parameter, the cmdlet prompts for a password.

    You can also create a **PSCredential** object by using a script or by using the **Get-Credential** cmdlet.
    You can then set the **Credential** parameter to the **PSCredential** object.

    If the acting credentials do not have directory-level permission to perform the task, Active Directory module for Windows PowerShell returns a terminating error.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ADDomainController" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an Active Directory domain controller object by providing one of the following values.
    The identifier in parentheses is the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) display name for the attribute.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - A GUID (objectGUID).
    - An IPV4Address.
    - A Global IPV6Address.
    - A DNS Host Name (dNSHostName).
    - A name of the server object.
    - A distinguished name of the NTDS Settings object.
    - A distinguished name of the server object that represents the domain controller.
    - A GUID of NTDS settings object under the configuration partition.
    - A GUID of server object under the configuration partition.
    - A distinguished name of the computer object that represents the domain controller.

    The cmdlet searches the default naming context or partition to find the object.
    If two or more objects are found, the cmdlet returns a non-terminating error.

    This parameter can also get the object through the pipeline or you can set this parameter to an object instance.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RevealedAccounts
  description: |+
    Specifies a search for accounts which have passwords that are stored on the read-only domain controller.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Server
  description: |+
    Specifies the Active Directory Domain Services instance to connect to by providing one of the following values for a corresponding domain name or directory server.
    The service may be any of the following: Active Directory Lightweight Domain Services, Active Directory Domain Services, or Active Directory snapshot instance.

    Specify the Active Directory Domain Services instance in one of the following ways: 

    Domain name values:

    - Fully qualified domain name.
    - NetBIOS name.

    Directory server values: 

    - Fully qualified directory server name.
    - NetBIOS name.
    - Fully qualified directory server name and port.

    The default value for this parameter is determined by one of the following methods in the order that they are listed:

    - By using the **Server** value from objects passed through the pipeline.
    - By using the server information associated with the Active Directory Domain Services Windows PowerShell provider drive when the cmdlet runs in that drive.
    - By using the domain of the computer running Windows PowerShell.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: ActiveDirectory.Get-ADDomainControllerPasswordReplicationPolicyUsage
name: Get-ADDomainControllerPasswordReplicationPolicyUsage
description: |-
  The **Get-ADDomainControllerPasswordReplicationPolicyUsage** cmdlet gets the user or computer accounts that are authenticated by a read-only domain controller (RODC) or that have passwords that are stored on that RODC.
  The list of accounts that are stored on a RODC is known as the revealed list.

  To get accounts that are authenticated by the RODC, use the **AuthenticatedAccounts** parameter.
  To get the accounts that have passwords stored on the RODC, use the **RevealedAccounts** parameter.

  The **Identity** parameter specifies the RODC.
  You can identify a domain controller by its GUID, IPV4Address, global IPV6Address, or DNS host name.
  You can also identify a domain controller by the name of the server object that represents the domain controller, the distinguished name distinguished name of the NTDS settings object of the server object, the GUID of the NTDS settings object of the server object under the configuration partition, or the distinguished name of the computer object that represents the domain controller.
  You can also set the **Identity** parameter to a domain controller object variable, such as **$\<localDomainControllerObject\>**, or pass a domain controller object through the pipeline to the **Identity** parameter.
  For example, you can use the Get-ADDomainController  cmdlet to retrieve a domain controller object and then pass the object through the pipeline to the **Get-ADDomainControllerPasswordReplicationPolicyUsage** cmdlet.
  If you specify a writeable domain controller for this cmdlet, the cmdlet returns a non-terminating error.
