parameters:
- type: <xref href="ADAuthType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AuthType
  description: |+
    Specifies the authentication method to use.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Negotiate or 0
    - Basic or 1

    The default authentication method is Negotiate.

    A Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection is required for the Basic authentication method.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Negotiate, Basic
- type: <xref href="PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Credential
  description: |+
    Specifies the user account credentials to use to perform this task.
    The default credentials are the credentials of the currently logged on user unless the cmdlet is run from an Active Directory module for Windows PowerShell provider drive.
    If the cmdlet is run from such a provider drive, the account associated with the drive is the default.

    To specify this parameter, you can type a user name such as User1 or Domain01\User01, or you can specify a **PSCredential** object.
    If you specify a user name for this parameter, the cmdlet prompts for a password.

    You can also create a **PSCredential** object by using a script or by using the **Get-Credential** cmdlet.
    You can then set the *Credential* parameter to the **PSCredential** object.

    If the acting credentials do not have directory-level permission to perform the task, Active Directory module for Windows PowerShell returns a terminating error.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ADCurrentForestType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Current
  description: |+
    Specifies whether to return the domain of the local computer or the current logged on user.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - LocalComputer or 0
    - LoggedOnUser  or 1

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: LocalComputer, LoggedOnUser
- type: <xref href="ADForest" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an Active Directory forest object by providing one of the following attribute values.
    The identifier in parentheses is the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) display name for the attribute.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - A fully qualified domain name
    - A GUID (objectGUID) 
    - A DNS host name
    - A NetBIOS name

    The cmdlet searches the default naming context or partition to find the object.
    If two or more objects are found, the cmdlet returns a non-terminating error.

    This parameter can also get this object through the pipeline or you can set this parameter to a forest object instance.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Server
  description: |+
    Specifies the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) instance to connect to, by providing one of the following values for a corresponding domain name or directory server.
    The service may be any of the following: Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS), AD DS, or Active Directory snapshot instance.

    Specify the AD DS instance in one of the following ways: 

    Domain name values:

    - Fully qualified domain name
    - NetBIOS name

    Directory server values:  

    - Fully qualified directory server name
    - NetBIOS name
    - Fully qualified directory server name and port

    The default value for this parameter is determined by one of the following methods in the order that they are listed:

    - By using the **Server** value from objects passed through the pipeline
    - By using the server information associated with the AD DS Windows PowerShell provider drive, when the cmdlet runs in that drive
    - By using the domain of the computer running Windows PowerShell

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: ActiveDirectory.Get-ADForest
name: Get-ADForest
description: |-
  The **Get-ADForest** cmdlet gets the specified Active Directory forest.
  You can specify the forest by setting the *Identity* or *Current* parameters.

  The *Identity* parameter specifies the Active Directory forest to get.
  You can identify a forest by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN), DNS host name, or NetBIOS name.
  You can also set the parameter to a forest object variable, such as `$<localForestObject>`, or you can pass a forest object through the pipeline to the *Identity* parameter.

  To get the forest of the local computer or current logged on user, set the *Current* parameter to LocalComputer or LoggedOnUser.
  When you set the *Current*parameter, you do not need to set the *Identity* parameter.

  When the *Current* parameter is set to LocalComputer or LoggedOnUser, the cmdlet uses the *Server* and *Credential* parameter values to determine the domain and the credentials to use to identify the domain of the forest according to the following rules:

  - If both the *Server* and *Credential* parameters are not specified:

  The domain is set to the domain of the LocalComputer or LoggedOnUser and a server is located in this domain.
  The credentials of the current logged on user are used to get the domain.

  - If the *Server* parameter is specified and the *Credential* parameter is not specified:

  The domain is set to the domain of the specified server and the cmdlet checks to make sure that the server is in the domain of the LocalComputer or LoggedOnUser.
  Then the credentials of the current logged on user are used to get the domain.
  An error is returned when the server is not in the domain of the LocalComputer or LoggedOnUser.

  - If the *Server* parameter is not specified and the *Credential* parameter is specified:

  The domain is set to the domain of the LocalComputer or LoggedOnUser and a server is located in this domain.
  Then the credentials specified by the *Credential* parameter are used to get the domain.

  - If the *Server* and *Credential* parameters are specified:

  The domain is set to the domain of the specified server and the cmdlet checks to make sure that the server is in the domain of the LocalComputer or LoggedOnUser.
  Then the credentials specified by the *Credential* parameter are used to get the domain.
  An error is returned when the server is not in the domain of the LocalComputer or LoggedOnUser.
