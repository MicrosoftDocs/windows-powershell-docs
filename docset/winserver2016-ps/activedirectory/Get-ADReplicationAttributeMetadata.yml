parameters:
- type: <xref href="ADAuthType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AuthType
  description: |+
    Specifies the authentication method to use.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Negotiate or 0
    - Basic or 1

    The default authentication method is Negotiate.

    A Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection is required for the Basic authentication method.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Negotiate, Basic
- type: <xref href="PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Credential
  description: |+
    Specifies a user account that has permission to perform this action.
    The default is the current user.

    Type a user name, such as User01 or Domain01\User01, or enter a **PSCredential** object, such as one generated by the **Get-Credential** cmdlet.
    If you type a user name, you are prompted for a password.

    This parameter is not supported by any providers installed with Windows PowerShell.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Filter
  description: |+
    Specifies a filter in the provider's format or language.
    The value of this parameter qualifies the *Path* parameter.
    The syntax of the filter, including the use of wildcards, depends on the provider.
    Filters are more efficient than other parameters, because the provider applies them when retrieving the objects, rather than having Windows PowerShell filter the objects after they are retrieved.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IncludeDeletedObjects
  description: |+
    Specifies to retrieve deleted objects and the deactivated forward and backward links.
    When this parameter is specified, the cmdlet uses the following Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) controls:

    - Show Deleted Objects (1.2.840.113556.1.4.417)
    - Show Deactivated Links (1.2.840.113556.1.4.2065)

    Note: If this parameter is not specified, the cmdlet does not return or operate on deleted objects.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ADObject" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Object
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an Active Directory object by providing one of the following property values.
    The identifier in parentheses is the LDAP display name for the attribute.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - A distinguished name
    - A GUID (objectGUID)

    The cmdlet searches the default naming context or partition to find the object.
    If two or more objects are found, the cmdlet returns a non-terminating error.

    This parameter can also get this object through the pipeline or you can set this parameter to an object instance.

    Derived types, such as the following are also accepted:

    - **Microsoft.ActiveDirectory.Management.ADGroup**
    - **Microsoft.ActiveDirectory.Management.ADUser**
    - **Microsoft.ActiveDirectory.Management.ADComputer**
    - **Microsoft.ActiveDirectory.Management.ADServiceAccount**
    - **Microsoft.ActiveDirectory.Management.ADFineGrainedPasswordPolicy**
    - **Microsoft.ActiveDirectory.Management.ADDomain**

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Properties
  description: |+
    Specifies a list of one or more attribute names as a comma separated list to return the metadata for replication partners.
    This parameter also accepts * (wildcard) to indicate to return all attributes set on the object.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "2"
  aliases: Property, Attribute, Attributes
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Server
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) instance to connect to, by providing one of the following values for a corresponding domain name or directory server.
    The service may be any of the following: Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS), AD DS, or Active Directory snapshot instance.

    Specify the AD DS instance in one of the following ways:  

    Domain name values:

    - Fully qualified domain name
    - NetBIOS name

    Directory server values:  

    - Fully qualified directory server name
    - NetBIOS name
    - Fully qualified directory server name and port

    The default value for this parameter is determined by one of the following methods in the order that they are listed:

    - By using the *Server* value from objects passed through the pipeline
    - By using the server information associated with the AD DS Windows PowerShell provider drive, when the cmdlet runs in that drive
    - By using the domain of the computer running Windows PowerShell

  defaultValue: None
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ShowAllLinkedValues
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet returns all linked values if the attribute returned is multi-valued.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: ActiveDirectory.Get-ADReplicationAttributeMetadata
name: Get-ADReplicationAttributeMetadata
description: |-
  The **Get-ADReplicationAttributeMetadata** cmdlet gets the replication metadata for one or more attributes on a given object.
  The metadata is contained in the following two directory objects:

  - Single-value attribute: **msDS-ReplAttributeMetaData**
  - Multi-value attribute: **msDS-ReplValueMetaData**

  The cmdlet parses the byte array(s) and returns the data in a readable format.
