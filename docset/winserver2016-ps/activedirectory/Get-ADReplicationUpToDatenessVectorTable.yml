parameters:
- type: <xref href="ADAuthType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AuthType
  description: |+
    Specifies the authentication method to use.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Negotiate or 0
    - Basic or 1

    The default authentication method is Negotiate.

    A Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection is required for the Basic authentication method.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Negotiate, Basic
- type: <xref href="PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Credential
  description: |+
    Specifies a user account that has permission to perform this action.
    The default is the current user.

    Type a user name, such as User01 or Domain01\User01, or enter a **PSCredential** object, such as one generated by the **Get-Credential** cmdlet.
    If you type a user name, you will be prompted for a password.

    This parameter is not supported by any providers installed with Windows PowerShell.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: EnumerationServer
  description: |+
    Specifies the Active Directory Domain Services instance to connect to, by providing one of the following values for a corresponding domain name or directory server.
    The service may be any of the following:  Active Directory Lightweight Domain Services, Active Directory Domain Services or Active Directory Snapshot instance.

    Specify the instance in one of the following ways:  

    Domain name values:

    - Fully qualified domain name
    - NetBIOS name

    Directory server values: 

    - Fully qualified directory server name
    - NetBIOS name
    - Fully qualified directory server name and port

    The default value for this parameter is determined by one of the following methods in the order that they are listed:

    - By using the *Server* value from objects passed through the pipeline
    - By using the server information associated with the Active Directory Domain Services Windows PowerShell provider drive, when the cmdlet runs in that drive
    - By using the domain of the computer running Windows PowerShell

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Filter
  description: |+
    Specifies a filter in the provider's format or language.
    The value of this parameter qualifies the *Path* parameter.
    The syntax of the filter, including the use of wildcards, depends on the provider.
    Filters are more efficient than other parameters, because the provider applies them when retrieving the objects, rather than having Windows PowerShell filter the objects after they are retrieved.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Partition
  description: |+
    Specifies the distinguished name of an Active Directory partition.
    The distinguished name must be one of the naming contexts on the current directory server.
    The cmdlet searches this partition to find the object defined by the *Identity* parameter.

    In many cases, a default value is used for the *Partition* parameter if no value is specified.
    The rules for determining the default value are given below.
    Note that rules listed first are evaluated first and once a default value can be determined, no further rules are evaluated.

    In Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) environments, a default value for *Partition* is set in the following cases: 

    - If the *Identity* parameter is set to a distinguished name, the default value of *Partition* is automatically generated from this distinguished name.
    - If running cmdlets from an Active Directory provider drive, the default value of *Partition* is automatically generated from the current path in the drive. 
    - If none of the previous cases apply, the default value of *Partition* is set to the default partition or naming context of the target domain.
    In Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) environments, a default value for *Partition* is set in the following cases:

    - If the *Identity* parameter is set to a distinguished name, the default value of *Partition* is automatically generated from this distinguished name. 
    - If running cmdlets from an Active Directory provider drive, the default value of *Partition* is automatically generated from the current path in the drive. 
    - If the target AD LDS instance has a default naming context, the default value of *Partition* is set to the default naming context.
    To specify a default naming context for an AD LDS environment, set the **msDS-defaultNamingContext** property of the Active Directory directory service agent object (**nTDSDSA**) for the AD LDS instance. 
    - If none of the previous cases apply, the *Partition* parameter does not take any default value.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "2"
  aliases: NC, NamingContext
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ADScopeType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Scope
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the type of object used as input by the *Target* parameter.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Server
    - Site
    - Domain
    - Forest

  defaultValue: None
  position: "1"
  aliases: ReplicationSite
  parameterValueGroup: Server, Domain, Forest, Site
- type: <xref href="Object" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Target
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies either one or more (using a comma separated list) of Active Directory domain controllers, sites, domains, or forests.
    It will return results for all the domain controllers that are specified or that are part of the specified container.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: Name, HostName, Site, Domain, Forest
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: ActiveDirectory.Get-ADReplicationUpToDatenessVectorTable
name: Get-ADReplicationUpToDatenessVectorTable
description: |-
  The **Get-ADReplicationUpToDatenessVectorTable** cmdlet displays the highest Update Sequence Number (USN) for the specified domain controller(s).
  This information shows how up-to-date a replica is with its replication partners. 
  During replication, each object that is replicated has USN and if the object is modified, the USN is incremented.
  The value of the USN for a given object is local to each domain controller where it has replicated are number is different on each domain controller.
