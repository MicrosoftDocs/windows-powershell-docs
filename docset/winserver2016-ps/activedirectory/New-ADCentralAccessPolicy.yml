    This command creates a central access rule named Finance Documents Rule with a new resource condition and new permissions.

    The new rule specifies that documents should only be read by members of the Finance department.
    Members of the Finance department should only be able to access documents in their own country.
    Only Finance Administrators should have write access.
    The rule allows an exception for members of the FinanceException group.
    This group will have read access.

    Targeting:

    - Resource.Department Contains Finance

    Access rules:

    - Allow Read User.Country=Resource.Country AND User.department = Resource.Department
    - Allow Full control User.MemberOf(FinanceAdmin)
    - Allow Read User.Country=Resource.Country AND User.department = Resource.DepartmentAllow Read User.MemberOf(FinanceException)

- type: <xref href="ADAuthType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AuthType
  description: |+
    Specifies the authentication method to use.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Negotiate or 0
    - Basic or 1

    The default authentication method is Negotiate.

    A Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection is required for the Basic authentication method.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Negotiate, Basic
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Credential
  description: |+
    Specifies the user account credentials to use to perform this task.
    The default credentials are the credentials of the currently logged on user unless the cmdlet is run from an Active Directory module for Windows PowerShell provider drive.
    If the cmdlet is run from such a provider drive, the account associated with the drive is the default.

    To specify this parameter, you can type a user name, such as User1 or Domain01\User01 or you can specify a **PSCredential** object.
    If you specify a user name for this parameter, the cmdlet prompts for a password.

    You can also create a **PSCredential** object by using a script or by using the **Get-Credential** cmdlet.
    You can then set the *Credential* parameter to the **PSCredential** object.

    If the acting credentials do not have directory-level permission to perform the task, Active Directory module for Windows PowerShell returns a terminating error.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Description
  description: |+
    Specifies a description of the object.
    This parameter sets the value of the **Description** property for the object.
    The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) display name (**ldapDisplayName**) for this property is description.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ADCentralAccessPolicy" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Instance
  description: |+
    Specifies an instance of an Active Directory object to use as a template for a new Active Directory object.

    You can use an instance of an existing Active Directory object as a template or you can construct a new Active Directory object by using the Windows PowerShell command line or by using a script.

    Method 1: Use an existing Active Directory object as a template for a new object.
    To retrieve an instance of an existing Active Directory object, use a cmdlet such as **Get-ADObject**.
    Then provide this object to the Instance parameter of the New-ADObject cmdlet to create a new Active Directory object.
    You can override property values of the new object by setting the appropriate parameters.

    Method 2: Create a new **ADObject** and set the property values by using the Windows PowerShell command line interface.
    Then pass this object to the *Instance* parameter of the **New-ADObject** cmdlet to create the new Active Directory object.

    Note: Specified attributes are not validated, so attempting to set attributes that do not exist or cannot be set will raise an error.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
