  name: Instance
  description: |+
    Specifies an instance of an Active Directory object to use as a template for a new claims transformation policy object.

    You can use an instance of an existing claims transformation policy object as a template or you can construct a new claims transformation policy object by using the Windows PowerShell command line or by using a script.

    Method 1: Use an existing claims transformation policy object as a template for a new object.
    To retrieve an instance of an existing claims transformation policy object, use  the  Get-ADClaimTransformPolicy cmdlet.
    Then provide this object to the *Instance* parameter of the **New-ADClaimTransformPolicy** cmdlet to create a new claims transformation policy object.
    You can override property values of the new object by setting the appropriate parameters.

    Method 2: Create a new **ADClaimsTransformationPolicy** object and set the property values by using the Windows PowerShell command line interface.
    Then pass this object to the Instance parameter of the **New-ADClaimTransformPolicy** cmdlet to create the new Active Directory object.

    Note: Specified attributes are not validated, so attempting to set attributes that do not exist or cannot be set will raise an error.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""

  name: Name
  isRequired: true

- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ProtectedFromAccidentalDeletion
  description: |+
    Specifies whether to prevent the object from being deleted.
    When this property is set to $True, you cannot delete the corresponding object without changing the value of the property.

    - $True or 1

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Rule
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the claims transformation rule.
    To specify the rule, you can either (1) type the rule in a text file, and then pass the file to the cmdlet (recommended), or (2) type the rule inline.

    For instance, the following commands demonstrate how to create a new claims transformation policy object with the rule specified in a text file named Rule.txt located in a temporary folder C:\temp.

    `$Rule = Get-Content C:\temp\rule.txt`

    `New-ADClaimTransformPolicy MyRule -Rule $Rule`

  defaultValue: None

    Specifies the Active Directory Domain Services instance to connect to, by providing one of the following values for a corresponding domain name or directory server.
    The service may be any of the following: Active Directory Lightweight Domain Services, Active Directory Domain Services or Active Directory snapshot instance.

    Specify the Active Directory Domain Services instance in one of the following ways: 

    Domain name values:

    - Fully qualified domain name
    - NetBIOS name

    Directory server values: 

    - Fully qualified directory server name
    - NetBIOS name
    - Fully qualified directory server name and port

    The default value for this parameter is determined by one of the following methods in the order that they are listed:

    - By using the *Server* value from objects passed through the pipeline
    - By using the server information associated with the Active Directory Domain Services Windows PowerShell provider drive, when the cmdlet runs in that drive
    - By using the domain of the computer running Windows PowerShell

  defaultValue: None

  The **New-ADClaimTransformPolicy** cmdlet creates a new claims transformation policy object in Active Directory.
  A claims transformation policy object contains a set of rules authored in the transformation rule language.
  After creating a policy object, you can link it with a forest trust to apply the claims transformation to the trust.
