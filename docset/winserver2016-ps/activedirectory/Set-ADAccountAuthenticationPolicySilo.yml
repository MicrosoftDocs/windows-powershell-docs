- title: 'Example 1: Assign an authentication policy silo and authentication policy'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Set-ADAccountAuthenticationPolicySilo -Identity User01 -AuthenticationPolicySilo AuthenticationPolicySilo01 -AuthenticationPolicy AuthenticationPolicy01
  description: |-
    This example assigns the authentication policy silo named AuthenticationPolicySilo01 and the authentication policy named AuthenticationPolicy01 to the user account named User01.

- title: 'Example 2: Assign an authentication policy silo and authentication policy by using a filter'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Get-ADComputer -Filter 'Name -like "NewComputer*"' | Set-ADAccountAuthenticationPolicySilo -AuthenticationPolicySilo AuthenticationPolicySilo02 -AuthenticationPolicy AuthenticationPolicy02
  description: |-
    This example first uses the **Get-ADComputer** cmdlet to get all computer accounts that match the filter specified by the Filter parameter.
    The output of this command is passed to **Set-ADAccountAuthenticationPolicySilo** to assign the authentication policy silo named AuthenticationPolicySilo02 and the authentication policy named AuthenticationPolicy02 to them.
  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="ADAuthenticationPolicy" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AuthenticationPolicy
  description: |+
    Specifies an Active Directory Domain Services authentication policy object.
    Specify the authentication policy object in one of the following formats: 

    - A distinguished name
    - GUID
    - Name

    This parameter can also get this object through the pipeline or you can set this parameter to an object instance.

    The cmdlet searches the default naming context or partition to find the object.
    If the cmdlet finds two or more objects, the cmdlet returns a non-terminating error.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ADAuthenticationPolicySilo" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AuthenticationPolicySilo
  description: |+
    Specifies an Active Directory Domain Services authentication policy silo object.
    Specify the authentication policy silo object in one of the following formats: 

    - A distinguished name
    - GUID
    - Name

    This parameter can also get this object through the pipeline or you can set this parameter to an object instance.

    The cmdlet searches the default naming context or partition to find the object.
    If the cmdlet finds two or more objects, the cmdlet returns a non-terminating error.

  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ADAuthType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AuthType
  description: |+
    Specifies the authentication method to use.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Negotiate or 0
    - Basic or 1

    The default authentication method is Negotiate.
    A Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection is required for the Basic authentication method.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Negotiate, Basic
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Credential
  description: |+
    Specifies a user account that has permission to perform the task.
    The default is the current user.
    Type a user name, such as User01 or Domain01\User01, or enter a **PSCredential** object, such as one generated by the **Get-Credential** cmdlet.

    By default, the cmdlet uses the credentials of the currently logged on user unless the cmdlet is run from an Active Directory Domain Services Windows PowerShell provider drive.
    If you run the cmdlet in a provider drive, the account associated with the drive is the default.

    If you specify credentials that do not have permission to perform the task, the cmdlet returns an error.

  defaultValue: None

    - distinguished name
    - GUID
    - Name

    This parameter can also get this object through the pipeline or you can set this parameter to an object instance.

    The service may be any of the following: Active Directory Lightweight Domain Services, Active Directory Domain Services or Active Directory snapshot instance.

    Specify the Active Directory Domain Services instance in one of the following ways:  

    Domain name values:

    - Fully qualified domain name
    - NetBIOS name

    Directory server values: 

    - Fully qualified directory server name
    - NetBIOS name
    - Fully qualified directory server name and port

    The default value for this parameter is determined by one of the following methods in the order that they are listed:

    - By using the *Server* value from objects passed through the pipeline
    - By using the server information associated with the Active Directory Domain Services Windows PowerShell provider drive, when the cmdlet runs in that drive
    - By using the domain of the computer running Windows PowerShell

  defaultValue: None

uid: ActiveDirectory.Set-ADAccountAuthenticationPolicySilo
name: Set-ADAccountAuthenticationPolicySilo
description: |-
  The **Set-ADAccountAuthenticationPolicySilo** cmdlet modifies the authentication policy or authentication policy silo of an account.
  This cmdlet assigns authentication policy silo objects and authentication policy object to an Active Directory Domain Services account.
  In order for the account to belong to an authentication policy silo, you must use the **Grant-ADAuthenticationPolicySiloAccess** cmdlet to grant access to the object.

  The *Identity* parameter specifies the Active Directory Domain Services authentication policy to modify.
  You can identify an authentication policy by its distinguished name, GUID or name.
  You can also use the *Identity* parameter to specify a variable that contains an authentication policy object, or you can use the pipeline operator to pass an authentication policy object to the *Identity* parameter.
