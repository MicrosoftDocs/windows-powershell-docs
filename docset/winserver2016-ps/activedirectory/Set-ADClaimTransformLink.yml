  code: |-
    PS C:\> New-ADClaimTransformPolicy -Identity DenyAllPolicy -DenyAll
    PS C:\> Set-ADClaimTransformLink "corp.contoso.com" -Policy DenyAllPolicy -TrustRole Trusted
    PS C:\> Set-ADClaimTransformLink "corp.contoso.com" -Policy DenyAllPolicy -TrustRole Trusting
  description: |-
    This command applies the claims transformation policy DenyAllPolicy to the trust corp.contoso.com.
    The rule is applied to where this domain acts as both the trusted and trusting domain in the trust.
    Effectively, the rule is applied to both claims coming in to this domain from its trust partner, and claims flowing out of this domain towards its trust partner.

    Since the specified transformation rule denies all claims to be sent or received, this domain will now deny all claims from being sent to or received from the other domain, the trust partner.

    PS C:\> Get-ADTrust "corp.contoso.com" | Set-ADClaimTransformLink -Policy AllowAllExceptCompanyAndDepartmentPolicy -TrustRole Trusted
  description: |-
    This command applies the claims transformation policy AllowAllExceptCompanyAndDepartmentPolicy to the trust corp.contoso.com.
    The rule is applied to where this domain acts as the trusted domain in the trust.
    Effectively, the rule is applied to claims flowing out of this domain towards its trust partner.

    Since the specified transformation rule allows all claims to be sent or received except Company and Department, this domain will now allow all claims except the two from being sent to the other domain, the trust partner.

  code: |-
    PS C:\> New-ADClaimTransformPolicy -Identity HumanResourcesToHrPolicy -Rule 'C1:[Type=="ad://ext/Department:88ce6e1cc00e9524", Value=="Human Resources", ValueType=="string"] => issue(Type=C1.Type, Value="HR", ValueType=C1.ValueType);'; 
    PS C:\> Set-ADClaimTransformLink -Identity "corp.contoso.com" -Policy HumanResourcesToHrPolicy -TrustRole Trusting
  description: |-
    This command applies the claims transformation policy HumanResourcesToHrPolicy to the trust corp.contoso.com.
    The rule is applied to where this domain acts as the trusting domain in the trust.
    Effectively, the rule is applied to claims coming in to this domain from its trust partner.

    Since the specified transformation rule transforms the value Human Resources into HR in the claim ad://ext/Department:88ce6e1cc00e9524, this domain will now transform the claim value received from the other domain, the trust partner, from Human Resources to HR.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="ADAuthType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AuthType
  description: |+
    Specifies the authentication method to use.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Negotiate or 0
    - Basic or 1

    The default authentication method is Negotiate.

    A Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection is required for the Basic authentication method.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Negotiate, Basic
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Credential
  description: |+
    Specifies the user account credentials to use to perform this task.
    The default credentials are the credentials of the currently logged on user unless the cmdlet is run from an Active Directory module for Windows PowerShell provider drive.
    If the cmdlet is run from such a provider drive, the account associated with the drive is the default.

    To specify this parameter, you can type a user name, such as User1 or Domain01\User01 or you can specify a **PSCredential** object.
    If you specify a user name for this parameter, the cmdlet prompts for a password.

    You can also create a **PSCredential** object by using a script or by using the **Get-Credential** cmdlet.
    You can then set the *Credential* parameter to the **PSCredential** object.

    If the acting credentials do not have directory-level permission to perform the task, Active Directory module for Windows PowerShell returns a terminating error.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ADTrust" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
