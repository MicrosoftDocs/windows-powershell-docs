parameters:
- type: <xref href="ADAuthType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AuthType
  description: |+
    Specifies the authentication method to use.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Negotiate or 0
    - Basic or 1

    The default authentication method is Negotiate.

    A Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection is required for the Basic authentication method.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Negotiate, Basic
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ForceRemoveLocal
  description: |+
    Indicates that you can remove the account from the local security authority (LSA) if there is no access to a writable domain controller.
    This is required if you are uninstalling the MSA from a server that is placed in a segmented network such as a perimeter network with access only to a read-only domain controller.
    If you specify this parameter and the server has access to a writable domain controller, the account is also un-linked from the computer account in the directory.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ADServiceAccount" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an Active Directory account object by providing one of the following property values.
    The identifier in parentheses is the LDAP display name for the attribute.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - A Distinguished Name
    - A GUID (objectGUID) 
    - A Security Identifier (objectSid) 
    - A SAM Account Name (sAMAccountName)

    The cmdlet searches the default naming context or partition to find the object.
    If two or more objects are found, the cmdlet returns a non-terminating error.

    This parameter can also get this object through the pipeline or you can set this parameter to an object instance.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"

  name: WhatIf

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: wi
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: ActiveDirectory.Uninstall-ADServiceAccount
name: Uninstall-ADServiceAccount
description: |-
  The **Uninstall-ADServiceAccount** cmdlet removes an Active Directory standalone managed service account (MSA) on the computer on which the cmdlet is run.
  For group MSAs, the cmdlet removes the group MSA from the cache.
  However, if a service is still using the group MSA and the host has permission to retrieve the password, then a new cache entry is created.
  The specified MSA must be installed on the computer.

  the *Identity* parameter specifies the Active Directory MSA to uninstall.
  You can identify an MSA by its distinguished name (DN), GUID, security identifier (SID), or Security Account Manager (SAM) account name.
  You can also set the parameter to an MSA object variable, such as `$<localServiceAccountObject>` or pass an MSA object through the pipeline to the *Identity* parameter.
  For example, you can use the **Get-ADServiceAccount** cmdlet to get an MSA object and then pass that object through the pipeline to the **Uninstall-ADServiceAccount** cmdlet.
