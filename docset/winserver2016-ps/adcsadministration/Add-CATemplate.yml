  The **Add-CATemplate** cmdlet adds a certificate template to the certificate authority (CA) for issuing.

  A certificate template is a preconfigured list of certificate settings that allows users and computers to enroll for certificates without having to create complex certificate requests.
  Certificate templates allow for the customization of a certificate that can be issued by the CA.
  The template defines items such as the cryptographic types, validity and renewal periods, and certificate purposes.

  The certificate templates are stored in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).
  Many default certificate templates are added to AD DS when the CA role service is installed.
  This cmdlet does not allow you to create new templates or duplicate existing templates.
