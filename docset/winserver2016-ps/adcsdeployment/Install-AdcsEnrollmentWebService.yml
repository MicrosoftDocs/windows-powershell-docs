  To see parameters, run the following command: `Install-AdcsEnrollmentWebService cmdlet -?`
  * You can get the CA configuration, which is the computer name and CA name by running certutil without any parameters. You can see the SSL certificate thumbprints assigned to the local computer by running the following commands:
   - `cd cert:\LocalMachine\My`
   - `dir | format-list`
