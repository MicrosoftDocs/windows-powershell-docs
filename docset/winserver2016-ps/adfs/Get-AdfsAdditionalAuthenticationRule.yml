description: |-
  The **Get-AdfsAdditionalAuthenticationRule** cmdlet retrieves the global rules that govern all applications that trigger additional authentication providers to be invoked.
  When the claim engine evaluates the additional authentication rules and determines that multiple factor authentication is required, the user is prompted to perform additional authentication.
  Use this rule only when all your applications are capable of performing web based credential collection through Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS).
  Applications that use protocols like WS-Trust will fail to obtain a security token if the trigger is true as a result of evaluation of the rules.
