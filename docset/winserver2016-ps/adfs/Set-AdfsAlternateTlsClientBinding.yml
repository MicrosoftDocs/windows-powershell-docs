  The **Set-AdfsAlternateTlsClientBinding** cmdlet configures an existing AD FS deployment to use the same port (443) for both device certificate and client certificate authentication (client TLS).
  The cmdlet creates an endpoint for user certificate authentication on `certauth`.\<federation service name\>, such as `certauth.contoso.com`.

  To change the deployment back to one in which user certificate authentication uses a non-standard port, use the Set-AdfsSslCertificate cmdlet with a new certificate that does not contain a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) for `certauth`.\<federation service name\>.

  The **Install-AdfsFarm** cmdlet configures client TLS on port 49443 if the SSL certificate does not contain a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) for `certauth`.\<federation service name\>, such as `certauth.contoso.com`.

  Use **Set-AdfsAlternateTlsClientBinding** with a new certificate that contains the SAN entry.
  It will configure AD FS to use port 443 for client TLS.
