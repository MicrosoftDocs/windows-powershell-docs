examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Test a server computer as a node in an existing federation server farm'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> $FScred = Get-Credential
    PS C:\> Test-AdfsFarmJoin -ServiceAccountCredential $FScred -SQLConnectionString "Data Source=SQLHost;Integrated Security=True"
  description: |-
    The first command uses the **Get-Credential** cmdlet to create a credential object for the Active Directory account under which the AD FS service runs.
    The command stores the credential object in the $FScred variable.

    The second command tests the joining of the local server computer as a node in an existing federation server farm that uses a SQL Server database that is installed on a computer named SQLHost.
    The command specifies the credentials that are stored in the $FScred variable for the Active Directory account under which the AD FS service runs.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 2: Test the overwrites of an existing AD FS configuration database'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> $FScred = Get-Credential
    PS C:\> Test-AdfsFarmJoin -OverwriteConfiguration -PrimaryComputerName "PrimaryWIDHost" -PrimaryComputerPort 80 -ServiceAccountCredential $FScred -CertificateThumbprint 8169c52b4ec6e77eb2ae17f028fe5da4e35c0bed
  description: |-
    The first command uses the **Get-Credential** cmdlet to create a credential object for the Active Directory account under which the AD FS service runs.
    The command stores the credential object in the $FScred variable.

    The second command tests the overwrites of an existing AD FS configuration database and tests the joining of the local server computer as a node in an existing federation server farm that uses the Windows Internal Database.
    The primary node of the farm is installed on a computer named PrimaryWIDHost.
    The command specifies the credentials that are stored in $FScred for the Active Directory account under which the AD FS service runs.

    The *CertificateThumbprint* parameter must specify the thumbprint of a certificate that is currently installed in the certificate store of the local computer.
    The certificate must be the same certificate that is used as the service communications certificate on the primary node.
