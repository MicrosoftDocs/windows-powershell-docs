  code: |-
    PS C:\> Get-BitsTransfer -JobId 10778CFA-C1D7-4A82-8A9D-80B19224879C | Add-BitsFile -Source http://server01/servertestdir/testfile1.txt -Destination "c:\clienttestdir\testfile1.txt"
  description: |-
    This command appends a file to the transfer queue of an existing BITS transfer job.

    In this example, the output of the **Get-BitsTransfer** cmdlet is a **BitsJob** object that is identified by its unique job ID.
    The command pipes the job ID to the **Add-BitsFile** cmdlet.
    The local and remote names of the file are in the parameters.

    PS C:\> $Bits = Get-BitsTransfer -JobId 10778CFA-C1D7-4A82-8A9D-80B19224879C

    This command appends a set of files to the transfer queue of an existing BITS transfer job.

    The first command retrieves the BITS transfer job that is identified by the job ID and then stores it in the $b variable.
    The second command uses the *BitsJob* parameter to pass the **BitsJob** object that is stored in the $b variable to **Add-BitsFile**.

    The server file names are paired with the corresponding client file names.

  code: |-
    PS C:\> $Bits = Start-BitsTransfer -Suspended

    PS C:\> Resume-BitsTransfer -BitsJob $Bits

    This example adds a set of files to the transfer queue of a new BITS transfer job.

    The first command creates a new BitsJob object and then stores it in the $Bits variable.

    The second command uses the **Import-CSV** cmdlet to import a text file that contains a list of files to be transferred.
    The text file is converted to an array of objects (one per line) and passed through the pipeline to the **Add-BitsFile** cmdlet.
    The *BitsJob* parameter is used to pass the **BitsJob** object (the transfer job) that is stored in the $Bits variable to the **Add-BitsFile** cmdlet. These array of objects, adds BITS transfer job for each of the file to be downloaded and then transfers them concurrently to the client. This command also updates the transfer job with the list of files to be transferred.

    The third command passes the **BitsJob** object that is stored in the $Bits variable to the **Resume-BitsTransfer** cmdlet.
    The BITS transfer job is restarted, and the files that are specified in the Filelist.txt file are transferred from the source to the destination.

    The `Import-CSV filelist.txt` element of the second command imports a text file that contains the list of files to be transferred.
    Each line of this file specifies a file to be transferred, in the `<Source>,<Destination>` format.
    The text file is converted to an array of objects, one per line, and passed through the pipeline.
    In this example, the array of objects is passed to the `Add-BitsFile` cmdlet.

    The contents of the Filelist.txt file resemble the following information:

    - **Source, Destination**
    - `http://server01/servertestdir/testfile1.txt, c:\clienttestdir\testfile1.txt`
    - `http://server01/servertestdir/testfile2.txt, c:\clienttestdir\testfile2.txt`
    - `http://server01/servertestdir/testfile3.txt, c:\clienttestdir\testfile3.txt`
    - `http://server01/servertestdir/testfile4.txt, c:\clienttestdir\testfile4.txt`

parameters:

  name: BitsJob
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the BITS transfer jobs to which you want to add files.
    You can pipe a value to this parameter from other cmdlets that return **BitsJob** objects, such as **Get-BitsTransfer**.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Destination
  description: |+
    Specifies the destination location and the names of the files that you want to transfer.
    The destination names are paired with the corresponding source file names.
    For instance, the first file name specified in the *Source* parameter corresponds to the first file name in the *Destination* parameter, and the second file name in the *Source*  parameter corresponds to the second file name in the *Destination* parameter.
    The *Source* and *Destination* parameters must have the same number of elements; otherwise, the command produces an error.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "2"

    Specifies the source location and the names of the files that you want to transfer.
    The source file names are paired with the corresponding destination file names.
    For instance, the first file name specified in the *Source* parameter corresponds to the first file name in the *Destination* parameter, and the second file name in the *Source* parameter corresponds to the second file name in the *Destination* parameter.
    The *Source* and *Destination* parameters must have the same number of elements; otherwise, the command produces an error.
    You can use standard wildcard characters such as the asterisk (*) and the question mark (?), or you can use a range operator such as "\[a-r\]".

description: |-
  The **Add-BitsFile** cmdlet adds files to a Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) transfer job.
  You can specify the files to add to the BITS transfer job by name at the command prompt or in a comma-separated value (CSV) file.

  Important: An upload job can contain only one file.
  To upload more than one file, use the **Import-Csv** cmdlet, and pipe the output to the **Add-BitsFile** cmdlet.
  For more information, see example 3 in this Help topic.
  Or, use a cabinet file (.cab) or a compressed file (.zip).
