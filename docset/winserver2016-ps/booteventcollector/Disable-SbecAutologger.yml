uid: BootEventCollector.Disable-SbecAutologger
name: Disable-SbecAutologger
description: |-
  The **Disable-SbecAutologger** cmdlet disables the forwarding of events to the Setup and Boot Event Collector in the AutoLogger settings in the registry.
  This has no immediate effect on the currently running log sessions, but takes effect after the operating system reboots and the AutoLogger service restarts the log sessions.

  The changes can be applied to the local computer, to a remote computer, or to an offline disk image.

  To operate on a local computer, specify the *Local* parameter.
  Enabling forwarding on the computer that runs the Collector service makes sense only if it sends the data to a Collector on a different computer.
  Otherwise, the in-kernel module is not able to connect to the Collector.
  However, you can copy the PowerShell BootEventCollector module to the other computers, where you can use it for local configuration.

  To operate on a remote computer, specify either the *ComputerName* or *Session* parameter.
  Windows PowerShell remoting is used to perform the remote operations.

  To operate on an offline (WIM or VHD) image, use the *Path* parameter.

  If you used the **Enable-SbecAutologger** cmdlet to convert some log sessions from file-based to real-time mode, this command undoes that conversion.

  If **Enable-SbecAutologger** created the NT Kernel Logger session, that session is **not** deleted by **Disable-SbecAutologger**.
  Only the forwarding of events from it to the Collector is disabled.

  If the Debug Print filter was modified by **Enable-SbecAutologger**, the change is **not** undone by **Disable-SbecAutologger**.
