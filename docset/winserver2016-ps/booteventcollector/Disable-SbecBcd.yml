parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BcdStore
  description: |+
    Specifies the full path of the BCD store.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: ComputerName
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the names of the computers on which you want to perform the operation.
    You can specify a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), a NetBIOS name, or an IP address for each computer.
    For more information, see [Invoke-CimMethod](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=808801) on TechNet.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Credential
  description: |+
    Specifies a user account that has permission to perform this action.
    The default is the current user.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DismLogPath
  description: |+
    Specifies the path of the file for the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) log when mounting images.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Id
  description: |+
    Specifies the ID of the entry to disable, without the curly braces.

    The BCD settings may contain entries for multiple boot images (when a computer has multiple operating system versions installed).
    When the settings for an operating system other than the currently running one (or the default operating system in an offline image) must be modified, you can use this parameter to select the entry.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Local
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Indicates that this operation occurs on the local computer.
    This mode also allows the extra control over the BCD store of where the settings are applied.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Path
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the list of full paths to the offline Windows image files (WIM or VHD) to which to apply the settings.
    If a WIM file contains multiple images, all of them are modified.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="PSSession" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Session
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the **PSSession** objects connected to the remote target computers.
    Enter a session object, such as the output of the **Get-PSSession** or **New-PSSession** cmdlet, or an array of these objects.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: BootEventCollector.Disable-SbecBcd
name: Disable-SbecBcd
description: |-
  The **Disable-SbecBcd** cmdlet disables the Boot Configuration Data (BCD) */event* flag.
  This operation has no effect on the current connections; you must reboot the computer for the settings to take effect.

  You can apply these changes to the local computer, to a remote computer, or to an offline disk image.

  To operate on a local computer, specify the *Local* parameter.
  Enabling forwarding on the computer that runs the Collector service makes sense only if it sends the data to a Collector on a different computer.
  Otherwise, the in-kernel module is not able to connect to the Collector.
  However, you can copy the PowerShell BootEventCollector module to the other computers, where you can use it for local configuration.

  To operate on a remote computer, specify either the *ComputerName* or *Session* parameter.
  Windows PowerShell remoting is used to perform the remote operations.

  To operate on an offline (WIM or VHD) image, use the *Path* parameter.
  WIM images do not normally contain the BCD files, and there is rarely a need to replace them there.
  Instead, Windows Setup creates the BCD settings when it extracts the image from WIM to the hard drive.
