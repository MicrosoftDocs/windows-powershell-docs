uid: BootEventCollector.Enable-SbecAutologger
name: Enable-SbecAutologger
description: |-
  The **Enable-SbecAutologger** cmdlet enables the forwarding of the events to the Setup and Boot Event Collector in the AutoLogger settings in the registry.
  This operation has no immediate effect on the currently running log sessions; it takes effect after the operating system reboots and the AutoLogger service restarts the log sessions.

  The changes can be applied to the local computer, to a remote computer, or to an offline disk image.

  To operate on a local computer, specify the *Local* parameter.
  Enabling forwarding on the computer that runs the Collector service makes sense only if it sends the data to a Collector on a different computer.
  Otherwise, the in-kernel module is not able to connect to the Collector.
  However, you can copy the PowerShell BootEventCollector module to the other computers, where you can use it for local configuration.

  To operate on a remote computer, specify either the *ComputerName* or *Session* parameter.
  Windows PowerShell remoting is used to perform the remote operations.

  To operate on an offline (WIM or VHD) image, use the *Path* parameter.

  This operation configures the event log session NT Kernel Logger (creating it if it does not exist) and, if present, EventLog-System and SetupPlatform to send events to the Boot Event Collector.
  You can configure other log sessions by specifying the *Logger* or *PermLogger* parameter.

  By default for the sessions NT Kernel Logger and EventLog-System, or when using the *Logger* parameter, the event log sessions are configured in such a manner that the event forwarding from them to the Collector becomes automatically disabled once the computer completes the boot sequence and the logging subsystem on it becomes fully functional.
  To let a session forward the events all the time, as is done by default for the session SetupPlatform, use the *PermLogger* parameter.

  You can enable forwarding only for the sessions in the real-time mode (as opposed to writing to a file), so by default the file-based sessions are left unchanged.
  You can use the *ForceLogger* parameter to change such sessions to the real-time mode and enable forwarding.

  This command also configures the Debug Print filter registry settings to pass, at minimum, Bugcheck messages for a system crash.

  You must enable **both** AutoLogger and BCD settings to forward events to the Boot Event Collector.
