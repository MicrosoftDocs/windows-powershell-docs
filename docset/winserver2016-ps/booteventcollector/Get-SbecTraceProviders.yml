  The **Get-SbecTraceProviders** cmdlet gets the list of ETW trace providers, building the hash tables for translation from name to GUID and back.

  **Get-SbecTraceProviders** returns a hash table with the following nested hash tables: 

  - `<ByName>`: Finds the provider object by name. 
  - `<ByGuid>`: Finds the provider object by GUID. 
  - `<NameToGuid>`: Translation of provider name (key) to GUID string (value). 
  - `<GuidToName>`: Translation of provider GUID (key) to name (value).

  Curly braces are added to the GUIDs when they are converted to strings.

  The returned hash table is also saved as a cache, and is returned on subsequent calls.
  If any new providers are defined, they are added to the cache (and thus to the previously returned references to it) on subsequent calls.
