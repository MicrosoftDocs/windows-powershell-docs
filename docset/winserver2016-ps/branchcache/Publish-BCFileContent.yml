  code: |-
    PS C:\> Publish-BCFileContent -Path "D:\share" -StageData

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 

    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt. 
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes. 
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets. 
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force
  description: |+
    Forces the command to run without asking for user confirmation.

  name: Path
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the file path or the path of a folder that contains files that this cmdlet hashes.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Recurse
  description: |+
    Indicates that hashes are created for content in subfolders.
    If you do not specify this parameter, this cmdlet creates hashes only for content in the top folder.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ReferenceFile
  description: |+
    Specifies a reference file from a previous run.
    A reference file contains a list of identifiers that describe the data in a data package.
    If you specify a reference file, this cmdlet excludes all data described in that file from the output.
    You can use a reference files to create data packages that only contain the changes from the previous time a data package was created.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: StageData
  description: |+
    Indicates that this cmdlet saves data to a staging area for future export using the **Export-BCCachePackage** cmdlet.
    If you do not specify this parameter, hashes are generated for data, but the data is not prepared for export.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: StagingPath
  description: |+
    Specifies a temporary folder to which this cmdlet saves the staging data.
    If you do not specify a location, this cmdlet uses a default location on the local hard disk.
    Use this parameter if a large data package is being created that must be housed on a separate hard disk.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: UseVersion
  description: |+
    Specifies the version of the BranchCache hashing scheme to use.
    If the version specified is 1, content information is generated according to the scheme used by Windows 7 clients.
    If version specified is 2, content information is generated according to the more efficient hashing scheme used by client computers that run operating systems later than Windows® 7.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named

  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: BranchCache.Publish-BCFileContent
name: Publish-BCFileContent
description: |-
  The **Publish-BCFileContent** cmdlet generates hashes, also called content information, for files in shared folders on file servers that have BranchCache enabled and the BranchCache for Network Files role service installed.

  This cmdlet is also used to stage data for the creation of a data preloading package.
  Run this cmdlet with the *StageData* parameter on one or more collections of files.
  Run the **Export-BCCachePackage** cmdlet to produce a data package that contains all the staged data.
  You can import that data package on remote hosted cache computers.
