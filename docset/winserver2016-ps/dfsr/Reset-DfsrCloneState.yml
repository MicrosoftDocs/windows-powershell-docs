  The **Reset-DfsrCloneState** cmdlet cancels an ongoing Distributed File System (DFS) Replication database cloning operation and resets the database of the volume to the previous state.

  When you cancel an export, the DFS Replication service restores the backup database copy that it created at the start of the process.
  When you cancel an import, the DFS Replication service deletes the new database copy.
  When you run the cmdlet, the cmdlet sends the reset and waits for the DFS Replication service to complete.
  Use the **Get-DfsrState** cmdlet to determine the current reset status.
