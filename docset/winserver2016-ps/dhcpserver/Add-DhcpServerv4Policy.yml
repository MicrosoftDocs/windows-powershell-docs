    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes.
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets.
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 
    For more information about Windows PowerShell® background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).
