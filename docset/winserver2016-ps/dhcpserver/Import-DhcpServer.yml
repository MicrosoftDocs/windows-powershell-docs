  description: |-
    This example imports a list of scopes specified in file named _ScopeList.txt_ to the DHCP server service that runs on the computer named dhcpserver.contoso.com.

    The **Import-Csv** cmdlet gets the list of scopes to import and returns it in the variable named _$ScopeIdList_. The second line imports the scopes using the variable named _$ScopeIdList_ as input for the _ScopeId_ parameter.

    The file named _ScopeList.txt_ should contain the following format: 

    ScopeID \
    10.10.10.0 \
    10.20.20.0 \
    10.30.30.0

  The **Import-DhcpServer** cmdlet imports the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server service configuration, and optionally lease data, from the specified file.

  If you specify either the *ScopeId* or the *Prefix* parameter, or both, only the specified scopes or prefixes are imported.

  If you specify neither the *ScopeId* nor the *Prefix* parameter, all of the configurations that is contained in the file, and optionally any lease data, is imported.

  If you specify the *Leases* parameter, the lease data in the specified file is imported in addition to configuration data.

  If you specify the *ScopeOverWrite* parameter and the scope being imported exists on the destination server, the scope on the target DHCP server service is overwritten.
  If this parameter is not specified and the scope being imported exists on the destination DHCP server service, a warning message is displayed and the import proceeds to process the next scope being imported.

  If you specify the *ServerConfigOnly* parameter, only the server level configuration is imported on the destination DHCP server service.
  If the file specified contains any scope information, the same information is not imported on the destination DHCP server service.
