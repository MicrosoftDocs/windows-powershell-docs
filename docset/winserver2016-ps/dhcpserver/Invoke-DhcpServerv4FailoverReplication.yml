parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job.
    Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 
    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt.
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes.
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets.
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 
    For more information about Windows PowerShell® background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ComputerName
  description: |+
    Specifies the DNS name, or IPv4 or IPv6 address, of the target computer that runs the DHCP server service.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Cn
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force
  description: |+
    Forces the command to run without asking for user confirmation.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Name
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the failover relationship.
    All scopes for one or more specified relationships are replicated to the partner DHCP server service.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="IPAddress" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: ScopeId
  description: |+
    Specifies the scope identifier (ID), in IPv4 address format, whose configuration are replicated.

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />

name: Invoke-DhcpServerv4FailoverReplication
description: |-
  The **Invoke-DhcpServerv4FailoverReplication** cmdlet replicates scope configuration between failover partner Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server services.

  If you specify the *ScopeId* parameter, if the scope is part of a failover relationship, the scope configuration for the specified scopes is replicated to the failover partner DHCP server service.
  The scope configuration includes all scope properties, reservations, scope option values, and policies.

  If you specify the *Name* parameter, the configuration for all of the scopes which are part of the failover relationship is replicated to the partner DHCP server service.

  If you specify no parameters, the configuration for all of the failover scopes on the DHCP server service will be replicated to the respective partner DHCP server services.
