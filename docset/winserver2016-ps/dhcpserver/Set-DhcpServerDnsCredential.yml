    This example saves a credential on a DHCP server.
    The DHCP server uses the credential to register or deregister client records on a DNS server.

    The first command uses the **Get-Credential** cmdlet to create a **PSCredential** object, and then stores it in the $Credential variable.
    The cmdlet prompts you for user name and password.
    For more information, type `Get-Help Get-Credential`.

    The second command specifies the credential object stored in the $Credential variable for the DHCP server named DhcpServer03.Contoso.com.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job.
    Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 
    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt.
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes.
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets.
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 
    For more information about Windows PowerShell® background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).
