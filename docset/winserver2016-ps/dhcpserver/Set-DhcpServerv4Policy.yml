  code: |-
    PS C:\> Set-DhcpServerv4Policy -ComputerName "dhcpserver.contoso.com" -Name "DevicesPolicy" -NewName TabletPolicy -Description "policy for tablet devices" -ProcessingOrder 4 -Enabled $False
  description: |-
    This example renames the server level policy named DevicesPolicy to TabletPolicy, sets a description string, disables the policy, and sets the processing order to 4.

- title: 'Example 2: Modify the conditions of the server level policy'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Set-DhcpServerv4Policy -Name "PhysicalMachinesPolicy" -Condition OR -MacAddress NE,00155D*,000569*
  description: |-
    This example modifies the conditions of the server level policy for non-Hyper-V clients.
    If the policy had an existing MAC address based condition, the same condition is replaced with the condition specified in this cmdlet.
    However, if the policy had conditions based on other fields, such as the *VendorClass*, *UserClass*, *ClientId*, or *RelayAgent* parameters, those is retained and logically combined (ORꞌd) with the newly added MAC address based condition.

  description: |-
    This example modifies the conditions of the server level policy for non-Hyper-V clients.
    If the policy had an existing MAC address based condition, a vendor class based policy, or both, the conditions are replaced with the condition specified in this cmdlet.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job.
    Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 
    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt.
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes.
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets.
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 
    For more information about Windows PowerShell® background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

name: Set-DhcpServerv4Policy
description: |-
  The **Set-DhcpServerv4Policy** cmdlet sets the properties of an existing policy either at the server level or at the specified scope level.
  If the *CircuitId*, *ClientId*, *Fqdn*, *MACAddress*, *RelayAgent*, *RemoteId*, *SubscriberId*, *UserClass*, or *VendorClass* parameter is specified, the conditions of the policy are being changed and this cmdlet behaves as follows:

  If the *VendorClass* parameter is specified and the policy being modified already has conditions for the *VendorClass* parameter value, the existing *VendorClass* parameter value is removed and the new *VendorClass* parameter value is added.

  However, if the policy being modified has conditions for the *MacAddress* parameter value, the *MacAddress* parameter value is not changed and is logically combined (ORꞌd) or differenced (ANDꞌd) with the *VendorClass*-based conditions.

  The same applies to any of the *CircuitId*, *ClientId*, *Fqdn*, *MACAddress*, *RelayAgent*, *RemoteId*, *SubscriberId*, *UserClass*, or *VendorClass* parameters that are used in the conditions.
