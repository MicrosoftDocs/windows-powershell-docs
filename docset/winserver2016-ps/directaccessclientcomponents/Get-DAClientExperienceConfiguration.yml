parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 

    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt. 
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes. 
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets. 
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: GPOSession
  description: |+
    Specifies the Group Policy session from which to read client experience configuration information.
    You can use *GPOSession* with the **NetGPO** cmdlets to aggregate multiple operations performed on a Group Policy Object.

    *GPOSession* cannot be used in conjunction with *PolicyStore*.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PolicyStore
  description: |+
    Specifies the policy store from which the cmdlet reads the client experience configuration information.

    To read the client experience configuration information from a Group Policy Object, specify the GPO name using the format "Domain\GPOName".

    To read the client experience configuration information from a computer's local GPO, specify the computer's local GPO name in the format "GPO:\<computername\>".

    *PolicyStore* cannot be used in conjunction with *GPOSession*.

    The default value for *PolicyStore* is ActiveStore.

  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  The **Get-DAClientExperienceConfiguration** cmdlet gets the configuration for the DirectAccess client user experience.
  The configuration controls the user interface behavior, as well as what configuration options are available to the user.

  All **DAClientExperienceConfiguration** cmdlets have an ADMX file that can also be used to configure the client experience settings.
