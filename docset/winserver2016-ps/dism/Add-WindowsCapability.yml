### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Installs a Windows capability package on the specified operating system image.
module: DISM
notes: |-
  As of Windows 10 version 1709, you cannot use Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) to host Features on Demand (FOD) and language packs for Windows 10 clients. Instead, you can enforce a Group Policy setting that tells the clients to download them directly from Windows Update. You can also host FOD and language packs on a network share, but starting with Windows 10 version 1809, FOD and language packs can only be installed from Windows Update. For more information, see [How to make Features on Demand and language packs available when you're using WSUS/Configuration Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/update/fod-and-lang-packs).

examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Add a Windows capability package to the running OS via the Windows Update client'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name "Msix.PackagingTool.Driver~~~~0.0.1.0"
  description: |-
    This command adds a Windows capability package to the running operating system. Because no source is specified, the Windows Update client will download the necessary package. It requires either an active Internet connection or an active network connection to the local Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) server.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 2: Add a Windows capability package to the running OS using a locally stored package file'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name "Msix.PackagingTool.Driver~~~~0.0.1.0" -Source "E:\" -LimitAccess
  description: |-
    This command adds a Windows capability package specified by the *Name* parameter, to the running operating system. The *Source* parameter specifies the location of required files. For instance, if the running OS is a copy of Windows 10 version 1809, the `Msix-PackagingTool-Driver-Package~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~.cab` file must be present at `E:\`.

    If the package specified by the *Name* parameter is already installed, this command does not return an error message, regardless of whether the required files are present at `E:\`.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 3: Add a Windows capability package to an image'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Add-WindowsCapability -Path "C:\mount\Windows" -Name "Msix.PackagingTool.Driver~~~~0.0.1.0" -Source "E:\"
  description: |-
    This command adds a Windows capability package specified by the *Name* parameter,  to the operating system image at the path C:\mount\Windows. The *Source* parameter specifies the location of required files. For instance, if the mount point contains a copy of Windows 10 version 1809, the `Msix-PackagingTool-Driver-Package~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~.cab` file must present at `E:\`.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: LimitAccess
  description: |+
    Indicates that this cmdlet does not query Windows Update for source packages when servicing a live OS. Only applies when the `-Online` switch is specified.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="LogLevel" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: LogLevel
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum output level shown in the logs.

  defaultValue: WarningsInfo
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: LL
  parameterValueGroup: Errors, Warnings, WarningsInfo
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: LogPath
  description: |+
    Specifies the full path and file name to log to.
    If not set, the default is `"$env:WINDIR\Logs\Dism\dism.log"`.
    In Windows PE, the default directory is the RAMDISK scratch space which can be as low as 32 MB.
    The log file will automatically be archived.
    The archived log file will be saved with .bak appended to the file name and a new log file will be generated.
    Each time the log file is archived the .bak file will be overwritten. 
    When using a network share that is not joined to a domain, use the net use command together with domain credentials to set access permissions before you set the log path for the DISM log.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: LP
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the identity of the capability to add to an operating system image.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Online
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet operates on a running operating system on the local host.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Path
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the full path to the root directory of the offline Windows image that you will service.
    If the directory named Windows is not a subdirectory of the root directory, *WindowsDirectory* must be specified.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ScratchDirectory
  description: |+
    Specifies a temporary directory that will be used when extracting files for use during servicing.
    The directory must exist locally.
    If not specified, the `"$env:Temp"` directory will be used, with a subdirectory name of a randomly generated hexadecimal value for each run of DISM.
    Items in the scratch directory are deleted after each operation. 
    You should not use a network share location as a scratch directory to expand a package (.cab or .msu file) for installation.
    The directory used for extracting files for temporary usage during servicing should be a local directory.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Source
  description: |+
    Specifies the location of the files that are required to add a Windows capability package to an image. If you specify multiple *Source* arguments, the files are gathered from the first location where they are found and the rest of the locations are ignored. Separate source locations with a comma.

    If you do not specify a *Source*, the default location set by Group Policy is used. If that fails, Windows Update is also used for online images, unless *LimitAccess* is specified. When all fail, the cmdlet fails silently; no exceptions are thrown.

    *Source* can only be used when servicing images that are running at least Windows® 8 or Windows Server® 2012.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SystemDrive
  description: |+
    Specifies the path to the location of the BootMgr files.
    This is necessary only when the BootMgr files are located on a partition other than the one that you are running the command from.
    Use -SystemDrive to service an installed Windows image from a Windows PE environment.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WindowsDirectory
  description: |+
    Specifies the path to the Windows directory relative to the image path.
    This cannot be the full path to the Windows directory; it should be a relative path.
    If not specified, the default is the Windows directory in the root of the offline image directory.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true

uid: DISM.Add-WindowsCapability
name: Add-WindowsCapability
description: |-
  The **Add-WindowsCapability** cmdlet acquires a Windows capability package from a priority-ordered list of source locations, and then installs the package on the specified operating system image.
