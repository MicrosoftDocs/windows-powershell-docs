  description: |-
    This command disables the optional feature, Calc, in the specified package in the Windows image that is mounted to c:\offline.
    It also removes all of the files except the manifest file, which reduces the size of the Windows image.
    The feature can be restored with the **Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature** cmdlet or by using Features on Demand at any time after the image is deployed.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: FeatureName
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the feature to be disabled.
    Feature names are case sensitive if you are servicing a Windows image other than Windows® 8 or a later version.
    You can use Get-WindowsOptionalFeature to find the name of the feature in the image.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="LogLevel" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: LogLevel
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum output level shown in the logs.
    The default log level is 3.
    The accepted values are as follows:
    - 1 = Errors only
    - 2 = Errors and warnings
    - 3 = Errors, warnings, and information
    - 4 = All of the information listed previously, plus debug output

  defaultValue: None

  name: LogPath
  description: |+
    Specifies the full path and file name to log to.
    If not set, the default is `%WINDIR%\Logs\Dism\dism.log`.
    In Windows PE, the default directory is the RAMDISK scratch space which can be as low as 32 MB.
    The log file will automatically be archived.
    The archived log file will be saved with .bak appended to the file name and a new log file will be generated.
    Each time the log file is archived the .bak file will be overwritten. 
    When using a network share that is not joined to a domain, use the net use command together with domain credentials to set access permissions before you set the log path for the DISM log.

  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Remove
  description: |+

    Remove can only be used when servicing an image contain Windows 8 or Windows Server 2012 or a later version.

    > [!NOTE]

    The directory must exist locally.
    If not specified, the `\Windows\%Temp%` directory will be used, with a subdirectory name of a randomly generated hexadecimal value for each run of DISM.
    Items in the scratch directory are deleted after each operation. 
    You should not use a network share location as a scratch directory to expand a package (.cab or .msu file) for installation.
    The directory used for extracting files for temporary usage during servicing should be a local directory.

  The **Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature** cmdlet disables or removes an optional feature in a Windows image.

  Use the *Online* parameter to specify the running operating system on your local computer, or use the *Path* parameter to specify the location of a mounted Windows image.

  The *PackageName* parameter specifies the package that the feature is a component of.
  This parameter is optional when the package is the Windows Foundation package.

  The *FeatureName* parameter specifies the feature to remove.
  You can specify more than one feature in the same package.
  Separate feature names with a comma.

  The *Remove* parameter removes the files for an optional feature without removing the feature's manifest from the image.
  You can use *Remove* to reduce the disk space that is used by a Windows image.
  After the image has been installed, you can restore the feature at any time from a remote source such as Windows Update or a network share.
