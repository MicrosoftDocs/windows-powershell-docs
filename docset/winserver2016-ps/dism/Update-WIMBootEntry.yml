  name: LogPath
  description: |+
    Specifies the full path and file name to log to.
    If not set, the default is `%WINDIR%\Logs\Dism\dism.log`.
    In Windows PE, the default directory is the RAMDISK scratch space which can be as low as 32 MB.
    The log file will automatically be archived.
    The archived log file will be saved with .bak appended to the file name and a new log file will be generated.
    Each time the log file is archived the .bak file will be overwritten. 
    When using a network share that is not joined to a domain, use the net use command together with domain credentials to set access permissions before you set the log path for the DISM log.

    Items in the scratch directory are deleted after each operation. 
    You should not use a network share location as a scratch directory to expand a package (.cab or .msu file) for installation.
    The directory used for extracting files for temporary usage during servicing should be a local directory.
