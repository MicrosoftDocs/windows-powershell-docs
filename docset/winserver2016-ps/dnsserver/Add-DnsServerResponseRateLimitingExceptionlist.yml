parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 

    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt. 
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes. 
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets. 
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimSession" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ClientSubnet
  description: |+
    Specifies the client subnet values for the exception list.

    This parameter must have the following format: `COMPARATOR, value1, value2,..., COMPARATOR, value 3, value 4,..` where the COMPARATOR can be EQ or NE.
    There can be only one EQ and one NE in a value.

    The values following the EQ operator will be treated as multiple assertions which are logically combined using the OR operator.
    The values following the NE operator will be treated as multiple assertions which are logically differenced using the AND operator.

    Multiple values are combined using the *Condition* parameter as a logical operator.
    The same operator is also used for combining EQ and NE expressions within a value.

    For example, `EQ, America, Asia, NE, Europe` specifies that the client subnets of America and Asia are in the exception list, and the client subnet of Europe is not.

    For details, see **Add-DnsServerClientSubnet**.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "2"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ComputerName
  description: |+
    Specifies a remote DNS server on which to run the command.
    You can specify an IP address or any value that resolves to an IP address, such as a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), host name, or NetBIOS name.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Cn
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Condition
  description: |+
    Specifies a logical operator for combining multiple values of the **ClientSubnet**, **Fqdn** and **ServerIp** parameters.
    The values for the parameters are combined using the *Condition* parameter as a logical operator.
    The same operator is also used for combining EQ and NE expressions within a value.
    The default value is AND.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "5"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: AND, OR
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Fqdn
  description: |+
    Specifies FQDN values for the exception list.

    The value must have the following format: `COMPARATOR, value1, value2,..., COMPARATOR, value 3, value 4,..` where the COMPARATOR can be EQ or NE.
    There can be only one EQ and one NE in a value.

    The values following the EQ operator will be treated as multiple assertions which are logically combined using the OR operator.
    The values following the NE operator will be treated as multiple assertions which are logically differenced using the AND operator.

    Multiple values are combined using the *Condition* parameter as a logical operator.
    The same operator is also used for combining EQ and NE expressions within a value.

    For example, `EQ,*.contoso.com` specifies that the contoso.com domain should be added to the exception list.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "3"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the RRL exception list.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PassThru
  description: |+
    Returns an object representing the item with which you are working.
    By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ServerInterfaceIP
  description: |+
    Specifies the server interface on which the DNS server is listening.

    The value must have the following format: `COMPARATOR, value1, value2,..., COMPARATOR, value 3, value 4,..` where the COMPARATOR can be EQ or NE.
    There can be only one EQ and one NE in a value.

    The values following the EQ operator are treated as multiple assertions which are logically combined using the OR operator.
    The values following the NE operator are treated as multiple assertions which are logically differenced using the AND operator.

    Multiple values are combined using the *Condition* parameter as a logical operator.
    The same operator is also used for combining EQ and NE expressions within a value.

    For example, `EQ,10.0.0.3` specifies that all queries received on a server interface that has the IP address of 10.0.0.3 should be exempt from RRL.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "4"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named

  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: DnsServer.Add-DnsServerResponseRateLimitingExceptionlist
name: Add-DnsServerResponseRateLimitingExceptionlist
description: |-
  The **Add-DnsServerResponseRateLimiting** cmdlet adds a Response Rate Limiting (RRL) exception list on the DNS server.
  The RRL exception list indicates that responses to queries for specified Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs), queries originating from specified client subnets, queries received on specified server interfaces, or any combination of these values, are exempt from RRL.
