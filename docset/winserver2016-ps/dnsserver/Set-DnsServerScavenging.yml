parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ApplyOnAllZones
  description: |+
    Indicates that the server settings apply on all zones.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 

    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt. 
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes. 
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets. 
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimSession" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ComputerName
  description: |+
    Specifies a remote DNS server.
    You can specify an IP address or any value that resolves to an IP address, such as a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), host name, or NETBIOS name.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Cn
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="TimeSpan" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: NoRefreshInterval
  description: |+
    Specifies a length of time as a **TimeSpan** object.
    **NoRefreshInterval** sets a period of time in which no refreshes are accepted for dynamically updated records.
    Zones on the server inherit this value automatically.

    This value is the interval between the last update of a timestamp for a record and the earliest time when the timestamp can be refreshed.
    The minimum value is 0.
    The maximum value is 8760 hours (seven days).

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "3"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PassThru
  description: |+
    Returns an object representing the item with which you are working.
    By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="TimeSpan" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RefreshInterval
  description: |+
    Specifies the refresh interval as a **TimeSpan** object.
    During this interval, a DNS server can refresh a resource record that has a non-zero time stamp.
    Zones on the server inherit this value automatically.

    If a DNS server does not refresh a resource record that has a non-zero time stamp, the DNS server can remove that record during the next scavenging.

    Do not select a value smaller than the longest refresh period of a resource record registered in the zone.

    The minimum value is 0.
    The maximum value is 8760 hours (seven days).
    The default value is the same as the **DefaultRefreshInterval** property of the zone DNS server.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "2"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="TimeSpan" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ScavengingInterval
  description: |+
    Specifies a length of time as a **TimeSpan** object.
    **ScavengingInterval** determines whether the scavenging feature for the DNS server is enabled and sets the number of hours between scavenging cycles.

    The default setting is 0, which disables scavenging for the DNS server.
    A setting greater than 0 enables scavenging for the server and sets the number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds (formatted as **dd.hh:mm:ss**) between scavenging cycles.
    The minimum value is 0.
    The maximum value is 365.00:00:00 (1 year).

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "4"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ScavengingState
  description: |+
    Specifies whether to Enable automatic scavenging of stale records.
    **ScavengingState** determines whether the DNS scavenging feature is enabled by default on newly created zones.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:
    - $False.
    Disables scavenging.
    This is the default setting.
    - $True.
    Enables scavenging

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: wi
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: DnsServer.Set-DnsServerScavenging
name: Set-DnsServerScavenging
description: |-
  The **Set-DnsServerScavenging** cmdlet changes scavenging settings on a Domain Name System (DNS) server.
  If any of the set operations fail, the cmdlet continues to configure other settings.
  The cmdlet displays the settings that it changed and the settings that it did not change.
