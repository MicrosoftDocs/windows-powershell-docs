parameters:
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Aging
  description: |+
    Indicates whether to enable aging and scavenging for a zone.
    Aging and scavenging are not enabled by default.

    For a value of $True, a DNS server refreshes time stamps for resource records when the server receives a dynamic update request.
    This enables DNS servers to scavenge resource records.

    For a value of $False, DNS servers do not refresh time stamps for resource records and do not scavenge resource records.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "2"
  aliases: AgingEnabled
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 

    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt. 
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes. 
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets. 
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ComputerName
  description: |+
    Specifies a DNS server.
    If you do not specify this parameter, the command runs on the local system.
    You can specify an IP address or any value that resolves to an IP address, such as a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), host name, or NETBIOS name.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Cn
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of a zone.
    This cmdlet is relevant only for primary zones.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ZoneName
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="TimeSpan" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: NoRefreshInterval
  description: |+
    Specifies the length of time as a TimeSpan object.
    This value is the interval between the last update of a timestamp for a record and the earliest time when the timestamp can be refreshed.
    The minimum value is 0.
    The maximum value is 8760 hours.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PassThru
  description: |+
    Returns an object representing the item with which you are working.
    By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="TimeSpan" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RefreshInterval
  description: |+
    Specifies the refresh interval as a TimeSpan object.
    During this interval, a DNS server can refresh a resource record that has a non-zero time stamp.

    If a resource record that has a non-zero time stamp is not refreshed for a period of the sum the values defined in the *NoRefreshInterval* parameter and the *RefreshInterval* parameter, a DNS server can remove that record during the next scavenging.

    Do not select a value smaller than the longest refresh period of a resource record registered in the zone.

    The minimum value is 0.
    The maximum value is 8760 hours.
    The default value is the same as the **DefaultRefreshInterval** property of the zone DNS server.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="IPAddress" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: ScavengeServers
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of IP addresses for DNS servers.
    These servers can scavenge records in this zone.
    If you do not specify any scavenge servers, any primary DNS server that is authoritative for the zone can scavenge.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: wi
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: DnsServer.Set-DnsServerZoneAging
name: Set-DnsServerZoneAging
description: |-
  The **Set-DnsServerZoneAging** cmdlet configures aging settings for a Domain Name System (DNS) server zone.

  A resource record can remain on a DNS server after the resource is no longer part of the network.
  Aging settings determine when a record can be removed, or scavenged, as a stale record.
