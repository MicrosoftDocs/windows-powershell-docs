parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Cluster
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the cluster on which to run this cmdlet.
    If the input for this parameter is `.` or it is omitted, then the cmdlet runs on the local cluster.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Dependency
  description: |+
    Specifies the dependency expression to set for this resource.
    The format for this is string is as follows. 
    `"[Resource Name 1] [and|or [Resource Name 2] [...] ]"Resource Name 1Resource Name 2`

     Resource names should be enclosed in square brackets as `[Cluster Disk 2]Cluster Disk 2`.
    To reset the resource dependency, use an empty string `""` in this parameter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="PSObject" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: InputObject
  description: |+
    Specifies the cluster resource for which to set the dependency expression.

  defaultValue: None

  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Resource
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the cluster resource for which to set the dependency expression.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "0"

  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: FailoverClusters.Set-ClusterResourceDependency
name: Set-ClusterResourceDependency
description: |-
  The **Set-ClusterResourceDependency** cmdlet specifies the resources that a particular resource depends on within a failover cluster.
  Existing dependencies will be overwritten by the dependencies that you specify.

  The term or can be used in the expression describing the dependency.
  For example, an or  dependency can be set up where a Network Name resource is dependent on either of two IP address resources, instead of being dependent on both.
  This use of or dependencies is common in multi-site cluster deployments.
