  name: Disk
  description: |+
    Specifies the disk number or disks for which to run the cmdlet.
    If the specified disk is online and is assigned to a clustered role or Cluster Shared Volume, you must also specify the *Force* parameter to take the disk offline for the duration of the storage tests.
    Otherwise, the specified disk must be offline before the cmdlet is run.
    If the *Disk* parameter is not specified, storage tests run on all disks that are available for use in the cluster or that are in the cluster resource offline or failed state.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Int32, Int64, Uint32, Uint64.
    A number that represents a master boot record (MBR) signature of the disk. 
    - **System.String**.
    A string that represents a master boot record (MBR) signature of the disk, hexadecimal format is supported. 
    - **System.String**.
    A string that represents the GUID of a GPT disk. 
    - **ClusterResource**.
    A cluster resource object that represents a clustered disk. 
    - **CimInstance#MSFT_Disk**.
    An object returned from Get-Disk, from the Windows PowerShell® storage module.

  name: Pool
  description: |+
    Specifies the clustered storage pool or pools for which to run the cmdlet.
    When the specified storage pool is online and a virtual disk in the storage pool is assigned to a clustered role or Cluster Shared Volume, you must also specify the **Force** parameter to take the storage pool offline for the duration of the storage tests.
    Otherwise, the specified storage pool must be taken offline before the storage tests.
    If the **Pool** parameter is not specified, storage tests run on all storage pools that are available for use in the cluster or that are in the cluster resource offline or failed state.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - **System.String**: A string that represents the name of the clustered storage pool or pools.

name: Test-Cluster
description: |-
  The **Test-Cluster** cmdlet runs validation tests for failover cluster hardware and settings.
  Tests can be run both before and after a cluster is set up.

  Test results are captured in a file with the file name that you specify.
  By running the validation tests, you can confirm that your hardware and settings are compatible with Failover Clustering.
  There are multiple types of tests, including Cluster, Inventory, Network, Storage, System, and other types of tests.
  Storage tests will not test online disks or storage pools that are in use by a clustered role.
  To test such disks, first run **Stop-ClusterGroup** to stop the clustered role, and then run **Test-Cluster**.
  After the tests are done, start the clustered roles, also known as resource groups, again.
