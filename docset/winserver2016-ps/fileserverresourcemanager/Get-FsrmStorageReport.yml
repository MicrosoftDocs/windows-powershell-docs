parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 

    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt. 
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes. 
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets. 
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

description: |-
  The **Get-FsrmStorageReport** cmdlet gets one or more storage reports on the server.
  This cmdlet gets all types of storage reports: scheduled, interactive, and incident reports.
  If you do not specify the *Name* parameter, this cmdlet gets all storage reports on the server.

  The object that this cmdlet returns does not include a property to indicate if a report is interactive.
  Use the Schedule property to determine if a report is interactive or is launched by an event incident, such as a quota event.
  If the Schedule property has a value, the report is scheduled.
  If the schedule property is null, the report is interactive or generated by an event.
