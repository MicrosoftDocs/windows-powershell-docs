- title: 'Example 1: Change the include pattern of a file group'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Set-FsrmFileGroup -Name "Media Files" -IncludePattern @("*.mp3", "*.wmv")
  description: |-
    This command changes the file group named "Media Files".
    After the cmdlet runs, the file group includes only files whose name ends in mp3 or wmv.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 2: Change the include pattern of a file group by using an object variable'
  code: |-
    The first command gets the file group named Media Files and stored the results in the variable $Group.
    PS C:\> $Group = Get-FsrmFileGroup "Media Files"

    The second command specifies an include pattern that includes .wma files for the file group stored in the variable $Group. The command stores the result in the $list variable.
    PS C:\> $list = $Group.IncludePattern + "*.wma"

    The third command sets the include pattern for the file group named Media Files to the include pattern stored in the variable $list.
    PS C:\> Set-FsrmFileGroup -Name "Media Files" -IncludePattern $list
  description: |-
    This example changes the file group named "Media Files".
    After the cmdlet runs, the file group also includes .wma files.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 

    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt. 
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes. 
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets. 
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).
