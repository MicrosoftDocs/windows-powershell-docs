parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 

    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt. 
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes. 
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets. 
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  name: Queue
  description: |+
    Indicates that the server adds the report to a queue and the report should run in the next 5 minutes.
    Any reports that the server queues during the next 5 minutes are run together.

- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

uid: FileServerResourceManager.Start-FsrmStorageReport
name: Start-FsrmStorageReport
description: |-
  The **Start-FsrmStorageReport** cmdlet starts generating one or more storage reports on demand.
  You cannot use this cmdlet to start interactive storage reports or storage reports that do not have a schedule.

  You can view the reports immediately after the server generates them or e-mail the reports to a group of administrators.
  If you choose to open the reports immediately, you must wait while the reports are generated.
  Processing time varies, depending on the types of reports and the scope of the data.
