### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Backs up one GPO or all the GPOs in a domain.
module: GroupPolicy
notes: |-
  * You can use the *Domain* parameter to explicitly specify the domain for this cmdlet.

    If you do not explicitly specify the domain, the cmdlet uses a default domain.
  The default domain is the domain that is used to access network resources by the security context under which the current session is running.
  This domain is typically the domain of the user that is running the session.
  For instance, the domain of the user who started the session by opening Windows PowerShell from the Program Files menu, or the domain of a user that is specified in a runas command.
  However, computer startup and shutdown scripts run under the context of the LocalSystem account.
  The LocalSystem account is a built-in local account, and it accesses network resources under the context of the computer account.
  Therefore, when this cmdlet is run from a startup or shutdown script, the default domain is the domain to which the computer is joined.

  code: |-
    PS C:\> Backup-Gpo -GUID fa4a9473-6e2a-4b87-ab78-175e68d97bde -Domain "contoso.com" -Server "DC1" -Path "\\Server1\GpoBackups"
  description: |-
    This command backs up the GPO with the specified GUID in the contoso.com domain to the \\\\Server1\GpoBackups directory.
    The domain controller at DC1.contoso.com is contacted to complete the operation.

    If the domain of the user running the session (or, for startup and shutdown scripts, the computer) is different from the contoso.com domain, a trust must exist between the two domains or the command fails.

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Comment
  description: |+
    Specifies a comment for the backed-up GPO.
    The comment string must be enclosed in double-quotation or single-quotation marks and can contain 2,047 characters.

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Domain
  description: |+
    Specifies the domain for this cmdlet.
    You must specify the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the domain (for example: sales.contoso.com).

    For the **Backup-GPO** cmdlet, the GPO to back up must exist in this domain.

    If you do not specify the *Domain* parameter, the domain of the user that is running the current session is used.
    (If the cmdlet is being run from a computer startup or shutdown script, the domain of the computer is used.) For more information, see the Notes section in the full Help.

    If you specify a domain that is different from the domain of the user that is running the current session (or, for a startup or shutdown script, the computer), a trust must exist between that domain and the domain of the user (or the computer).

    You can also refer to Domain by its built-in alias, domainname.
    For more information, see about_Aliases.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: DomainName
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Guid" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Guid
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the GPO to backup by its globally unique identifier (GUID).
    The GUID uniquely identifies the GPO.

    You can also refer to the *Guid* parameter by its built-in alias, id.
    For more information, see **about_Aliases**.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: Id

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the GPO to backup by its display name.

    The display name is not guaranteed to be unique in the domain.
    If another GPO with the same display name exists in the domain an error occurs.
    You can use the *Guid* parameter to uniquely identify a GPO.

    You can also refer to the Name parameter by its built-in alias, displayname.
    For more information, see **about_Aliases**.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: DisplayName
  parameterValueGroup: ""
