### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Gets one GPO or all the GPOs in a domain.
module: GroupPolicy
notes: |-
  * You can use the *Domain* parameter to explicitly specify the domain for this cmdlet.

    If you do not explicitly specify the domain, the cmdlet uses a default domain.
  The default domain is the domain that is used to access network resources by the security context under which the current session is running.
  This domain is typically the domain of the user that is running the session.
  For example, the domain of the user who started the session by opening Windows PowerShell from the Program Files menu, or the domain of a user that is specified in a runas command.
  However, computer startup and shutdown scripts run under the context of the LocalSystem account.
  The LocalSystem account is a built-in local account, and it accesses network resources under the context of the computer account.
  Therefore, when this cmdlet is run from a startup or shutdown script, the default domain is the domain to which the computer is joined.

    Only one domain can be used by an instance of this cmdlet.
  If you pipe a collection of GPO (Microsoft.GroupPolicy.Gpo) objects to this cmdlet, the DomainName property of the first GPO object in the collection specifies the domain for the cmdlet.
  This is because domainname is a built-in alias for the *Domain* parameter, and the *Domain* parameter can take its value by property name from the pipeline.
  A non-terminating error occurs for any GPOs in the collection that are not in this domain.
  If this domain is different from the domain of the user account (for startup or shutdown scripts, the computer account), a trust must exist between the two domains.

    This command gets the GPO named Group Policy Test.
    The GPO must exist in the domain of the user that is running the session (or, for startup and shutdown scripts, the computer).
    The command gets the GPO information by contacting the primary domain controller (PDC).

    This command gets the GPO that has the ID (GUID) 331a09564-cd4a-4520-98fa-446a2af23b4b in the sales.contoso.com domain.
    If the domain of the user that is running the session (or, for startup and shutdown scripts, the computer) is different that sales.contoso.com, a trust must exist between the two domains.
    The command retrieves the GPO information by contacting the PDC (in the sales.contoso.com domain).

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: All
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet gets all the GPOs in the domain.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Domain
  description: |+
    Specifies the domain for this cmdlet.
    You must specify the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the domain.

    For the **Get-GPO** cmdlet, the GPO (or GPOs) to that this cmdlet gets must exist in this domain.

    If you do not specify the *Domain* parameter, the domain of the user that is running the current session is used.
    If the cmdlet is being run from a computer startup or shutdown script, the domain of the computer is used.
    For more information, see the Notes section in the full Help.

    If you specify a domain that is different from the domain of the user that is running the current session (or, for a startup or shutdown script, the computer), a trust must exist between that domain and the domain of the user or the computer.

    You can also refer to the *Domain* parameter by its built-in alias, domainname.
    For more information, see about_Aliases.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: DomainName
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Guid" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Guid
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the GPO to retrieve by its globally unique identifier (GUID).
    The GUID uniquely identifies the GPO.

    You can also refer to the *Guid* parameter by its built-in alias, id.

  description: |+
    Specifies the GPO to retrieve by its display name.

    The display name is not guaranteed to be unique in the domain.
    If another GPO with the same display name exists in the domain an error occurs.
    You can use the Guid parameter to uniquely identify a GPO.

    You can also refer to the *Name* parameter by its built-in alias, displayname.

  defaultValue: None

  name: Server
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the domain controller that this cmdlet contacts to complete the operation.
    You can specify either the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or the host name.

    If you do not specify the name by using the Server parameter, the primary domain controller (PDC) emulator is contacted.

    You can also refer to the Server parameter by its built-in alias, dc.

  defaultValue: None

  The **Get-GPO** cmdlet gets one Group Policy Object (GPO) or all the GPOs in a domain.
  You can specify a GPO by its display name or by its globally unique identifier (GUID) to get a single GPO, or you can get all the GPOs in the domain through the *All* parameter.

  This cmdlet returns one or more objects that represent the requested GPOs.
  By default, properties of the requested GPOs are printed to the display; however, you can also pipe the output of the **Get-GPO** cmdlet to other Group Policy cmdlets.
