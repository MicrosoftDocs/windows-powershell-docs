### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Gets one or more registry-based policy settings under either Computer Configuration or User Configuration in a GPO.
module: GroupPolicy
notes: |-
  * The hive of the registry key that you specify (HKLM or HKCU) indicates whether the registry-based policy setting is retrieved from Computer Configuration or User Configuration.

    If the specified registry key cannot be located in policy (the registry key is not configured), a corresponding error message is displayed.

    You can use the *Domain* parameter to explicitly specify the domain for this cmdlet.

    If you do not explicitly specify the domain, the cmdlet uses a default domain.
  The default domain is the domain that is used to access network resources by the security context under which the current session is running.
  This domain is typically the domain of the user that is running the session.
  For instance, the domain of the user who started the session by opening Windows PowerShell or the domain of a user that is specified in a runas command.
  However, computer startup and shutdown scripts run under the context of the LocalSystem account.
  The LocalSystem account is a built-in local account, and it accesses network resources under the context of the computer account.
  Therefore, when this cmdlet is run from a startup or shutdown script, the default domain is the domain to which the computer is joined.

    You can pipe a GPO for which this cmdlet gets registry-based policy settings.
    Collections that contain GPOs from different domains are not supported.

    This cmdlet returns **PolicyRegistrySetting** objects that represent registry-based policy settings.
    These objects can be piped into the following cmdlets:

    This command gets all the registry-based policy settings that configure registry values under the key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\ExampleKey from User Configuration in the GPO named TestGPO.
    Subkeys of this key that have registry-based policy settings, are also returned.
    The second registry-based policy setting (ValueTwo) is disabled (its **PolicyState** property is set to Delete).
  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Domain
  description: |+
    Specifies the domain for this cmdlet.
    You must specify the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the domain (for instance: sales.contoso.com).

    For the **Get-GPRegistryValue** cmdlet, the GPO for which to get registry-based policy settings must exist in this domain.

    If you do not specify the *Domain* parameter, the domain of the user that is running the current session is used.
    If the cmdlet is being run from a computer startup or shutdown script, the domain of the computer is used.
    For more information, see the Notes section in the full Help.

    If you specify a domain that is different from the domain of the user that is running the current session (or, for a startup or shutdown script, the computer), a trust must exist between that domain and the domain of the user or the computer.

    You can also refer to Domain by its built-in alias, domainname.
    For more information, see about_Aliases.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: DomainName
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Guid" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Guid
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the GPO from which to retrieve the registry-based policy setting by its globally unique identifier (GUID).
    The GUID uniquely identifies the GPO.

    You can also refer to the *Guid* parameter by its built-in alias, id.
    For more information, see **about_Aliases**.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: Id
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Key
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the registry key for which this cmdlet gets the registry-based policy setting.
    For instance: HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\DNSClient.

    The key must be in one of the two following registry hives:

    - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (HKLM) for a registry-based policy setting in Computer Configuration.

    - HKEY_CURRENT_USER (HKCU) for a registry-based policy setting in User Configuration.

    You can specify:

    - The *Key* parameter without the *ValueName* parameter to get all the registry-based policy settings that configure values directly under that key.

    - The Key parameter together with the *ValueName* parameter to get the registry-based policy setting that configures a specific registry value.

    You can also refer to the *Key* parameter by its built-in alias FullKeyPath.
    For more information, see **about_Aliases**.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: FullKeyPath
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the GPO from which this cmdlet gets the registry-based policy setting by its display name.

    The display name is not guaranteed to be unique in the domain.
    If another GPO with the same display name exists in the domain an error occurs.
    You can use the *Guid* parameter to uniquely identify a GPO.

    You can also refer to the *Name* parameter by its built-in alias, displayname.
    For more information, see **about_Aliases**.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: DisplayName
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Server
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the domain controller that this cmdlet contacts to complete the operation.
    You can specify either the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or the host name.

    If you do not specify the name by using the *Server* parameter, the primary domain controller (PDC) emulator is contacted.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: DC
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ValueName
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of a registry value for which this cmdlet gets the registry-based policy setting.
    For instance, the registry key HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\DNSClient can have a value with the following name: UseDomainNameDevolution.
    For the default value of a registry key, specify "(default)" or an empty string ("").

    You must also specify the *Key* parameter with this parameter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: GroupPolicy.Get-GPRegistryValue
name: Get-GPRegistryValue
description: |-
  The **Get-GPRegistryValue** cmdlet retrieves one or more registry-based policy settings under either Computer Configuration or User Configuration in a Group Policy Object (GPO).

  You can get registry-based policy settings for a specific registry value, or for all the registry values under a key:

  - To get the registry-based policy setting that configures a specific registry value, specify both the *Key* and the *ValueName* parameters.

  - To get all the registry-based policy settings that configure values directly under a registry key, specify the *Key* parameter without the *ValueName* parameter.

  If you specify only a key, in addition to the policy settings that configure values under the key, the following first-level subkeys of the key are returned:

  - first-level subkeys that have a policy setting that configures a value.

  - first-level subkeys that have a subkey, at any level, with a policy setting that configures a value.

  You can use this information to browse for registry-based policy settings.
