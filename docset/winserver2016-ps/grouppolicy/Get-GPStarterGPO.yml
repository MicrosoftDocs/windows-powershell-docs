### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Gets one Starter GPO or all Starter GPOs in a domain.
module: GroupPolicy
notes: |-
  * You can use the *Domain* parameter to explicitly specify the domain for this cmdlet.

    If you do not explicitly specify the domain, the cmdlet uses a default domain.
  The default domain is the domain that is used to access network resources by the security context under which the current session is running.
  This domain is typically the domain of the user that is running the session, for instance, the domain of the user who started the session by opening Windows PowerShell or the domain of a user that is specified in a runas command.
  However, computer startup and shutdown scripts run under the context of the LocalSystem account.
  The LocalSystem account is a built-in local account, and it accesses network resources under the context of the computer account.
  Therefore, when this cmdlet is run from a startup or shutdown script, the default domain is the domain to which the computer is joined.

    Specifies the domain for this cmdlet.
    You must specify the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the domain.

    For the **Get-GPStarterGPO** cmdlet, the Starter GPO must exist in this domain.

    If you do not specify the *Domain* parameter, the domain of the user that is running the current session is used.
    If the cmdlet is being run from a computer startup or shutdown script, the domain of the computer is used.
    For more information, see the Notes section in the full Help.

    If you specify a domain that is different from the domain of the user that is running the current session (or, for a startup or shutdown script, the computer), a trust must exist between that domain and the domain of the user, or the computer.

    You can also refer to the *Domain* parameter by its built-in alias, domainname.
    For more information, see about_Aliases.

  defaultValue: None

    If another Starter GPO with the same display name exists in the domain an error occurs.
    You can use the *Guid* parameter to uniquely identify a Starter GPO.

    You can also refer to the *Name* parameter by its built-in alias, displayname.
    For more information, see **about_Aliases**.

    Specifies the name of the domain controller that this cmdlet contacts to complete the operation.
    You can specify either the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or the host name.

    If you do not specify the name by using the *Server* parameter, the primary domain controller (PDC) emulator is contacted.

    You can also refer to the *Server* parameter by its built-in alias, dc.
