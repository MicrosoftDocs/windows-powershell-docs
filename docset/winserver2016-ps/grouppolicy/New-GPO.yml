### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Creates a GPO.
module: GroupPolicy
notes: |-
  * Only domain administrators, enterprise administrators, and members of the Group Policy creator owners group can create GPOs. These users must run Windows PowerShell in an elevated state.

    You can use the *Domain* parameter to explicitly specify the domain for this cmdlet.

    If you do not explicitly specify the domain, the cmdlet uses a default domain.
  The default domain is the domain that is used to access network resources by the security context under which the current session is running.
  This domain is typically the domain of the user that is running the session.
  For instance, the domain of the user who started the session by opening Windows PowerShell from the Program Files menu, or the domain of a user that is specified in a RunAs command.
  However, computer startup and shutdown scripts run under the context of the LocalSystem account.
  The LocalSystem account is a built-in local account, and it accesses network resources under the context of the computer account.
  Therefore, when this cmdlet is run from a startup or shutdown script, the default domain is the domain to which the computer is joined.

    This command creates a GPO named TestGPO, links it to the Marketing OU in the contoso.com domain, and grants the Marketing Admins security group permissions to edit the GPO.

    A GPO object is returned by the command, so you could continue to configure the new GPO by piping the output to other cmdlets.
    For example, you could set Registry preference items or registry-based policy settings by piping the output to Set-GPPrefRegistryValue or to Set-GPRegistryValue.
  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Comment
  description: |+
    Includes a comment for the new GPO.
    The comment string must be enclosed in double- or single-quotation marks and can contain 2,047 characters.

    Use the comment to document the GPO and its implementation in your environment.
    Or, if you insert keywords in the comment, you can use the keyword filter to find GPOs that have matching keywords.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Domain
  description: |+
    Specifies the domain for this cmdlet.
    You must specify the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the domain.

    For the **New-GPO** cmdlet:

    - The new GPO is created in this domain.

    - If a Starter GPO is specified, it must exist in this domain.

    If you do not specify the *Domain* parameter, then the domain of the user running the current session is used.
    If the cmdlet is being run from a computer startup or shutdown script, the domain of the computer is used.
    For more information, see the Notes section in the full help.

    If you specify a domain that is different from the domain of the user running the current session (or the computer for a startup or shutdown script), then a trust must exist between that domain and the domain of the user, or computer.

    You can also refer to the *Domain* by its built-in alias, domainname.
    For more information, see about_Aliases.

  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: DomainName
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies a display name for the new GPO.

    If another GPO with the same display name exists in the domain an error occurs.

    You can also refer to the *Name* parameter by its built-in alias, displayname.
    For more information, see **about_Aliases**.

  name: Server
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the domain controller that this cmdlet contacts to complete the operation.
    You can specify either the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or the host name.

    If you do not specify the name by using the *Server* parameter, the primary domain controller (PDC) emulator is contacted.

    You can also refer to the *Server* parameter by its built-in alias, dc.
    For more information, see **about_Aliases**.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: DC
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Guid" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: StarterGpoGuid
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies a Starter GPO by its globally unique identifier (GUID).
    The GUID uniquely identifies the Starter GPO.
    If a Starter GPO is specified, the GPO is created with its settings.

    You can also refer to the *StarterGpoGuid* parameter by its built-in alias, id.
    For more information, see **about_Aliases**.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: Id
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />

    The name can contain 255 characters.
    If the name includes blank characters, enclose the name in double-quotation marks or single-quotation marks.
    If a Starter GPO is specified, the GPO is created with its settings.

    The display name is not guaranteed to be unique in the domain.
    If another Starter GPO with the same display name exists in the domain, an error occurs.
    You can use the *StarterGpoGuid* parameter to uniquely identify a Starter GPO.

    You can also refer to the *Name* parameter by its built-in alias, displayname.
    For more information, see **about_Aliases**.

uid: GroupPolicy.New-GPO
name: New-GPO
description: |-
  The **New-GPO** cmdlet creates a GPO with a specified name.
  By default, the newly created GPO is not linked to a site, domain, or organizational unit (OU).

  You can use this cmdlet to create a GPO that is based on a starter GPO by specifying the GUID or the display name of the Starter GPO, or by piping a **StarterGpo** object into the cmdlet.

  The cmdlet returns a **GPO** object, which represents the created GPO that you can pipe to other Group Policy cmdlets.
