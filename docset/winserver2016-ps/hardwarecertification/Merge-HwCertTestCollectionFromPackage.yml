    PS C:\> Merge-HwCertTestCollectionFromPackage -LiteralPath ("C:\Temp\BasicTest.hckx", "C:\Temp\CertificationTest.hckx")
  description: |-
    This command merges the results in two .hckx package files.
    The command specifies files named BasicTest.hckx and CertificationTest.hckx.

- title: 'Example 2: Merge two package files and export the result information'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Merge-HwCertTestCollectionFromPackage -LiteralPath ("C:\Temp\BasicTest.hckx", "C:\Temp\CertificationTest.hckx") | Export-HwCertTestCollectionToXml -Output "C:\Temp\Merged.xml"
  description: |-
    This command merges the results in two .hckx package files and exports the result information to an .xml file named Merged.xml.
    The command merges files named BasicTest.hckx and CertificationTest.hckx.
    The command passes the merged results to the **Export-HwCertTestCollectionToXml** cmdlet by using the pipeline operator.
    That cmdlet exports the results.

- title: 'Example 3: Merge several package files and export the result information'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Get-ChildItem -Recurse "C:\Temp\*.hckx" | Merge-HwCertTestCollectionFromPackage | Export-HwCertTestCollectionToXml -Output "C:\Temp\Merged.xml"
  description: |-
    This command merges the results in all the .hckx package files in a specified folder and exports the merged result information to an .xml file named Merged.xml.
    The command uses the **Get-ChildItem** cmdlet to get all the .hckx files in the C:\Temp folder.
    For more information, type `Get-Help Get-ChildItem`.
    The command passes the .hckx files to the **Merge-HwCertTestCollectionFromXml** cmdlet by using the pipeline operator.
    That cmdlet merges the test results.
    The command then passes the merged results to the **Export-HwCertTestCollectionToXml** cmdlet.
    That cmdlet exports the results.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet parses the .hckx package files, and then replaces any existing cached .xml files.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: HckBuildVersion
  description: |+
    Specifies an HCK build version.
    This cmdlet merges the results that match this build version only.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Build, Version
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IncludeAll
  description: |+
    If specified, the merge includes all test results, including any that passed, and any that failed, such as those with "not-run" results.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: LiteralPath
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of file paths.
    These are file paths to .hckx package files.
    You must have write permission for the folders that contain these files.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ValidationXmlPath
  description: |+
    Specifies the path of a test collection .xml file to use for validation.
    The cmdlet checks the new test collection against the validation collection to ensure that at least one result exists.
    Validation helps to determine that all the tests merged from child lab collections meet the goals of the original test collection.

    To obtain a test collection file for validation, use the **New-HwCertTestCollection** cmdlet, along with the **Export-HwCertTestCollectionToXml** cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: XML

name: Merge-HwCertTestCollectionFromPackage
description: |-
  The **Merge-HwCertTestCollectionFromPackage** cmdlet merges the test result information from several .hckx package files into a single test collection.
  For more information, see [Windows Hardware Certification Kit downloads](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=614978) in the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) Library.

  You can use the **Export-HwCertTestCollectionToXml** cmdlet to export the merged test collection as an .xml file.
  You can use the **New-HwCertTestCollectionExcelReport** cmdlet to create a Microsoft Excel report of the test results.

  The cmdlet parses each .hckx package file, and then generates a cached .xml file in the same location as each parsed file.
  Therefore, you must have write permission for the folders that contain the .hckx package files.
