  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of full paths.
    These are file paths to merged test collection .xml files.
    You can specify up to eight files.

    The cmdlet uses the order of the files in this parameter to determine the order of the N-1 regression data comparison.
    For example, the second file is compared with the first file, and the third file is compared with the second file.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "0"

  The **New-HwCertTestCollectionExcelReport** cmdlet creates a Windows Hardware Certification Kit (HCK) test summary report as a Microsoft Excel workbook.
  Specify one or more merged test collection .xml files.
  The cmdlet creates a separate worksheet for each merged test collection file, aggregates results, and compares the same test target from each file in a summary report.
  The summary shows total pass, pass with filter, fail, and N-1 regression data.
  For more information, see [Windows Hardware Certification Kit downloads](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=614978) in the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) Library.

  You can use up to ten results per test in the test result aggregation process.
  The most recent passing result takes precedence as the aggregate.

  The maximum number of test collections for a summary report is eight.
  If you specify a single merged test collection, the report includes the summary for that test pass without N-1 regression comparisons.

  To create merged test result collection files, use the **Merge-HwCertTestCollectionFromPackage** and **Merge-HwCertTestCollectionFromXml** cmdlets, along with the **Export-HwCertTestCollectionToXml** cmdlet.
