  description: |+
    Specifies one or more Hyper-V hosts from which to get replication statistics.
    NetBIOS names, IP addresses, and fully qualified domain names are allowable.
    The default is the local computer.
    Use localhost or a dot (.) to specify the local computer explicitly.

  defaultValue: None

    Replication statistics are retrieved for all virtual machines from the specified primary server.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: PrimaryServer
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ReplicaServerName
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of a Replica server of the virtual machines whose replication statistics you want to get.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ReplicaServer
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="VMReplicationHealthState" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ReplicationHealth
  description: |+
    Specifies the replication health of the virtual machines whose replication statistics you want to get.
    Valid values are "Critical", "Warning", "Normal", and "NotApplicable".

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Health
  parameterValueGroup: NotApplicable, Normal, Warning, Critical
- type: <xref href="VMReplicationMode" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ReplicationMode
  description: |+
    Specifies the replication mode of the virtual machines whose replication statistics you want to get.

  name: ReplicationRelationshipType
  description: |+
    Specifies the replication relationship type of the virtual machine.
    Specify whether the replication relationship is a simple primary to replica or is an extended replication chain.
    The cmdlet gets replication statistics and information associated with the virtual machines that have the replication type that you specify.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Relationship
  parameterValueGroup: Simple, Extended
- type: <xref href="VMReplicationState" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ReplicationState
