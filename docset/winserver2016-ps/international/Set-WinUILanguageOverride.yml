  The **Set-WinUILanguageOverride** cmdlet sets a user-preferred display language to be used for the Windows user interface (UI).
  If no override setting is used, the display language is dynamically determined from the language list of the user. Log off and loging back on is required for changes to take place.

  For more information, see the **Get-WinUserLanguageList** and **Set-WinUserLanguageList** cmdlets.
