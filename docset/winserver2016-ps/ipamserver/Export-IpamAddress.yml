parameters:
- type: <xref href="AddressFamily" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AddressFamily
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an address family of IP addresses.The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - IPv4
    - IPv6

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: IPv4, IPv6
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 

    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt. 
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes. 
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets. 
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimSession" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet overwrites a CSV file that has the same name that you specify for the *Path* parameter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="VirtualizationType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: NetworkType
  description: |+
    Specifies an IPv4 or IPv6 network prefix, in Classless InterDomain Routing (CIDR) notation.
    This parameter specifies the IP subnet of the IP address range for which to import the addresses.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: NonVirtualized, Provider, Customer
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PassThru
  description: |+
    Returns an object representing the item with which you are working.
    By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Path
  description: |+
    Specifies the absolute path of the exported CSV file.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: IpamServer.Export-IpamAddress
name: Export-IpamAddress
description: |-
  The **Export-IpamAddress** cmdlet exports all of the IP addresses from an address family in IP Address Management (IPAM).
  The cmdlet exports the IP addresses as a comma-separated value (CSV) file.

  The field header names and the enumerated values of IP address objects that this cmdlet exports have English names that are culture-independent (invariant) and are not in the localized language that the server uses.
  The field header names follow the Windows PowerShell property naming conventions.
  The format of date and time values of the exported objects are in the localized format of the computer that runs the IPAM server and not in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

  The IPAM client console and IPAM Server cmdlets in Windows PowerShell support interoperability between import and export functionality of English and localized CSV files, provided that the language and locale of the computers that run the IPAM server that import and export IP addresses are the same.
  You can import a localized CSV file that you export from a computer that runs the IPAM client UI by using IPAM Windows PowerShell.
  You can import an English CSV file that you exported by using IPAM Windows PowerShell from a computer that runs the IPAM client provided the language and locale of the computers that run the IPAM client and IPAM server are the same.
