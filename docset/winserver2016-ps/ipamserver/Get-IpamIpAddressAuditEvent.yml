parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 

    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt. 
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes. 
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets. 
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

  name: ClientId
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of client IDs.
    Use this parameter to search for audit events by Media Access Control (MAC) address.
    You may use dashes (-) in the client ID but they are not required.

  name: CorrelateLogonEvents
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet correlates logon events.
    Use this parameter to include or exclude user and computer events from domain controllers and NPS servers.
    If you specify this parameter, logon events are included in the correlated set of events retrieved by this cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="DateTime" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: EndDate
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the end date, as a **DateTime** object, for which to get the event data.
    To get a **DateTime** object, use the **Get-Date** cmdlet and specify the date in **DD/MM/YYYY** format.

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  description: |+
    Specifies an array of user names.
    Use this parameter to search correlated events by username.
    Searching by user's domain name is not supported.
    Logon events are included in this search because user names are not specified in DHCP lease events.

uid: IpamServer.Get-IpamIpAddressAuditEvent
name: Get-IpamIpAddressAuditEvent
description: |-
  The **Get-IpamIpAddressAuditEvent** cmdlet gets all IP address audit events from an IP Address management (IPAM) server over a time interval.
  IPAM enables IP address tracking through correlation of Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) lease events on managed DHCP servers with user and computer authentication events on managed domain controllers and Network Policy Server (NPS) servers.
  You can search correlated events by IP address, client ID, hostname, or username.
  Use DHCP events between a start date and an end date to correlate data.
  The data returned includes data for both the start date and the end date.

  The cmdlet returns only the top 10,000 rows if the query results exceed more than 10,000 rows.
  The cmdlet will display a warning if this occurs.
  You can avoid this situation if you narrow the search criteria to limit the results.
