  code: |-
    PS C:\> Import-IpamAddress -AddressFamily IPv4 -Path "C:\Addressv4.csv" -Force
  description: |-
    This command imports the IPv4 addresses from the file C:\Addressv4.csv into the IPAM server.
    The new addresses are added and existing addresses are edited.
    The errors, if any, are recorded in the Documents folder of the user in CSV file format.
    The command runs without user confirmation.

- title: 'Example 2: Import IPv4 addresses and record errors'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Import-IpamAddress -AddressFamily IPv4 -Path "C:\addressv4.csv" -ErrorPath "C:\" -Force
  description: |-
    This command imports IPv4 addresses from the file C:\Addressv4.csv into the IPAM server.
    The command adds new addresses and modifies and existing addresses.
    The command records errors that occur during the import a CSV file at the path C:\.

    The command includes the *PassThru* parameter, so it displays results to the console.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 3: Import and update IPv4 addresses in a range'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Import-IpamAddress -AddressFamily IPv4 -Path "C:\addressupdatev4.csv" -ManagedByService "IPAM" -ServiceInstance "Localhost" -NetworkId "10.10.10.0/24"
    Confirm 

    Imports a csv file as an update of all IP address records that belong to the specified IP address range. Along with adding new addresses and editing existing addresses, this operation also deletes addresses belonging to the specified IP address range from IPAM database, that are not present in the csv file update being imported. 


    Continue with this operation?

  description: |-
    This command imports and updates all of the IPv4 addresses from the specified path that belong to the range specified by the network ID 10.10.10.0/24, the managing service IPAM, and the service instance Localhost.
    The cmdlet calculates the start IP address as 10.10.10.1 and the end IP address as 10.10.10.254.
    The cmdlet adds new addresses, changes existing addresses, and removes addresses that belong to the specified range which are not in the CSV file.
    By default, host IDs that contain all zeros (0) and all ones (1) are skipped for IPv4 address ranges while calculating the starting and ending IP address.

uid: IpamServer.Import-IpamAddress
name: Import-IpamAddress
description: |-
  The **Import-IpamAddress** cmdlet imports IP addresses from a comma-separated values (CSV) file into the IP Address Management (IPAM) server.

  The cmdlet supports two parameter sets.
  The Import parameter set adds IP address objects from the CSV file into the IPAM server and updates the existing address objects with updated information specified in the CSV file.

  Use the *InventoryImport* parameter set to periodically import and update all of the IP address objects that map to the IP address range that you specify by using the unique combination of the *NetworkId*, *ManagedByService*, *ServiceInstance*, *StartIPAddress*, and *EndIPAddress* parameters.
  In addition to adding new addresses and changing existing addresses, this operation also removes the addresses which map to the IP address range that you specify but do not exist in the .csv file that you import.
  The import and update operations of IP addresses for an IP address range succeed only if the range exists the IPAM server.

  The only field required in the CSV file that you import is the IP address.
  Other address-specific fields or custom fields can be specified in any order in the import CSV file.

  The IPAM Windows PowerShell import supports both the English and server localized .csv files.
  The IPAM server uses the presence of the field name IPAddress in the CSV file to determine that the file must be processed in English format.
  If the field name IPAddress is not present in the CSV file, the CSV file is processed in the server localized format for the field names and enumeration values.
  The format of date and time values of the imported objects are interpreted in the localized format of the computer that runs the IPAM server and not in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
