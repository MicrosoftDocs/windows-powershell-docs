description: |-
  The **Import-IpamRange** cmdlet imports IP address range objects from the specified comma-separated values (.csv) file into the IP Address Management (IPAM) server.
  IPAM server does not support import of IP address ranges that have the *ServiceInstance* parameter value of `MS DHCP`.
  This is reserved for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) scopes automatically discovered by the IPAM server from the managed computers that run Microsoft DHCP server services.
  Any objects that fail to import during the operation are logged in the appropriate error log file for further analysis.

  This cmdlet supports two parameter sets.
  The default invocation of the cmdlet adds new IP address range objects from the .csv file into the IPAM server and edits the existing address ranges with updated information specified in the .csv file.

  The second parameter set can be used to periodically import and update all IP address range objects that belong to the specified unique combination of the *ManagedByService* and *ServiceInstance* parameters, in the IPAM server.
  In addition to add and edit operations to existing ranges, this import operation also deletes those ranges from the IPAM server which have the same value as the *ManagedByService* and *ServiceInstance* parameters but are not present in the .csv file that is imported.
  This parameter set provides you with the option to delete the IP addresses that map to the IP address ranges that are deleted during import through the *DeleteMappedAddresses* parameter.

  The import and update of IP address ranges for the specified *ManagedByService* and *ServiceInstance* parameter values succeeds if these values are present on the IPAM server at the time of import.
  The *AddManagedByService* and *AddServiceInstance* can be used to create the specified *ManagedByService* and *ServiceInstance* parameter values within the IPAM server at run-time before the import operation, if required.

  The network identifier (ID) field is required to import IPAM ranges to the .csv file.
  Any other range specific basic field or custom field can be specified in any order in the .csv file for import.
  Sample format of import .csv file, can be generated using IPAM export functionality from IPAM UI (localized format) or IPAM Windows PowerShell® (English format).

  The IPAM Windows PowerShell import supports both English as well as server localized .csv file.
  The IPAM server uses presence of the field named **NetworkId** (without spaces) in the .csv file to ascertain that the file must be processed in English format.
  Otherwise the file is processed in the server localized format for the various field names and enumeration values.
  The format of date and time values of the imported objects are always interpreted in the localized format of the IPAM server and not in Universal Time Coordinate (UTC).
