parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ArpOffload
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet manages the address resolution protocol (ARP) offload capability of the adapter.

    The computer, when in low power mode using the ARP offload technology, is able to offload the responsibility of handling responses for incoming ARP protocol requests.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job.
    Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 
     The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt.
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes.
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets.
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 
     For more information about Windows PowerShellÂ® background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: D0PacketCoalescing
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet manages the D0 packet coalescing capability of the network adapter.

    This feature enables power saving on the computer by reducing the number of receive interrupts.
    This reduces the number of receive interrupts by coalescing random broadcast or multicast packets.
    The processing overhead and power consumption is significantly reduced on the computer.

    This feature allows the device to stand-by in a low power mode when media is disconnected and wake when media is connected again.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IncludeHidden
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet includes both visible and hidden network adapters in the operation.
    By default only visible network adapters are included.
    If a wildcard character is used in identifying a network adapter and this parameter has been specified, then the wildcard string is matched against both hidden and visible network adapters.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimInstance" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>

    You can use this parameter, or you can pipe the input to this cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: InterfaceDescription
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of network adapter interface descriptions.
    For a physical network adapter this is typically the name of the vendor of the network adapter followed by a part number and description, such as `Contoso 12345 Gigabit Network Device`.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ifDesc, InstanceID
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: NoRestart
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet does not restart the network adapter after completing the operation.
    Many advanced properties require restarting the network adapter before the new settings take effect.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: NSOffload
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet manages the neighbor solicitation (NS) offload capability of the network adapter.

    The computer, when in low power mode using the NS offload technology, is able to offload the handling of responses for incoming NS protocol requests.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PassThru
  description: |+
    Returns an object representing the item with which you are working.
    By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RsnRekeyOffload
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet manages the Wi-Fi robust security network (RSN) rekey offload capability of the network adapter.

    The computer, when it goes into sleep state, is able to offload the group temporal key (GTK) rekeying for wake on wireless LAN (WoWLAN).

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SelectiveSuspend
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet manages the selective suspend capability of the network adapter.

    The network drive interface specification (NDIS) selective suspend interface allows NDIS to suspend an idle network adapter by transitioning the adapter to a low-power state.
    This enables the computer to reduce the power overhead on the CPU and network adapter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WakeOnMagicPacket
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet manages the wake on magic packet capability of the network adapter.

    The magic packet is a broadcast frame containing anywhere within its payload 6 bytes of all 255 (FF FF FF FF FF FF) in hexadecimal), followed by sixteen repetitions of the 48-bit MAC address of the target computer, for a total of 102 bytes.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WakeOnPattern
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet manages the wake on pattern capability of the network adapter.

    A wake pattern refers to network packet filters that determine if incoming network traffic should wake the computer.
    These patterns can be enabled on the network adapter.

    The following wake patterns may be supported by a network adapter: 
    - Wake Pattern 
    - Wake on new incoming TCP connection for IPv4 and IPv6 including TCP SYN IPv4 and TCP SYN IPv6. 
    - 802.1x re-authentication packets 
    - Bitmapped Patterns.
    Most network adapters can be programmed with bit-mapped pattern filters.
    Bitmapped patterns are defined by a bit-map mask and a pattern filter.
    As a network packet is received, it is masked using the bitmap mask and then compared to the pattern filter.
    If there is a match, then the network adapter wakes the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"
