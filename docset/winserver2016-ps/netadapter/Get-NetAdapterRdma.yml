parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job.
    Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 
     The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt.
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes.
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets.
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 
     For more information about Windows PowerShell® background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimSession" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IncludeHidden
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet includes both visible and hidden network adapters in the operation.
    By default only visible network adapters are included.
    If a wildcard character is used in identifying a network adapter and this parameter has been specified, then the wildcard string is matched against both hidden and visible network adapters.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: InterfaceDescription
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of network adapter interface descriptions.
    For a physical network adapter this is typically the name of the vendor of the network adapter followed by a part number and description, such as `Contoso 12345 Gigabit Network Device`.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ifDesc, InstanceID
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Name
  description: |+
    Specifies an array network adapter names.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: ifAlias, InterfaceAlias
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: NetAdapter.Get-NetAdapterRdma
name: Get-NetAdapterRdma
description: |-
  The **Get-NetAdapterRdma** cmdlet gets the remote direct memory access (RDMA) properties of an RDMA-capable network adapter.
  RDMA is a feature that enables network adapters to transfer data directly between each other without requiring the main processor of the system to be part of that transfer.
  This results in lower latency and lower processor utilization.
