parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimSession" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="LacpTimers" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: LacpTimer
  description: |+
    Specifies how often inter-connected devices exchange LACP protocol data units (PDUs) or control messages.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "5"
  aliases: lt
  parameterValueGroup: Slow, Fast
- type: <xref href="LBAlgos" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: LoadBalancingAlgorithm
  description: |+
    Specifies the load-balancing algorithm the new team uses to distribute network traffic between the interfaces.

    You can specify one of the following load balancing algorithms:

    - Dynamic.
    Uses the source and destination TCP ports and the IP addresses to create a hash for outbound traffic.  Moves outbound streams from team member to team member as needed to balance team member utilization.
    When you specify this algorithm with the *TeamingMode* parameter and the SwitchIndependent value, inbound traffic is routed to a particular team member.

    - TransportPorts.
    Uses the source and destination TCP ports and the IP addresses to create a hash and then assigns the packets that have the matching hash value to one of the available interfaces.
    When you specify this algorithm with the *TeamingMode* parameter and the SwitchIndependent value, all inbound traffic arrives on the primary team member.

    - IPAddresses.
    Uses the source and destination IP addresses to create a hash and then assigns the packets that have the matching hash value to one of the available interfaces.
    When you specify this algorithm with the *TeamingMode* parameter and the SwitchIndependent value, all inbound traffic arrives on the primary team member.

    - MacAddresses.
    Uses the source and destination MAC addresses to create a hash and then assigns the packets that have the matching hash value to one of the available interfaces.
    When you specify this algorithm with the *TeamingMode* parameter and the SwitchIndependent value, all inbound traffic arrives on the primary team member.

    - HyperVPort.
    Distributes network traffic based on the source virtual machine Hyper-V switch port identifier.
    When you specify this algorithm with the *TeamingMode* parameter and the SwitchIndependent value, inbound traffic is routed to the same team member as the switch port's outgoing traffic.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "4"
  aliases: lba
  parameterValueGroup: TransportPorts, IPAddresses, MacAddresses, HyperVPort, Dynamic
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the new NIC team.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="TeamingModes" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: TeamingMode
  description: |+
    Specifies the mode of the NIC teaming.
    You can specify one of the following three teaming modes:

    - LACP.
    Uses the IEEE 802.1ax Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) to dynamically identify links that are connected between the host and a given switch.
    (This protocol was formerly known as IEEE 802.3ad draft.)

    - Static.
    Requires configuration on both the switch and the host to identify which links form the team.

    - SwitchIndependent.
    Specifies that a network switch configuration is not needed for the NIC team.
    Because the network switch is not configured to know about the interface teaming, the team interfaces can be connected to different switches.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "3"
  aliases: tm
  parameterValueGroup: Static, SwitchIndependent, Lacp
- type: <xref href="WildcardPattern" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: TeamMembers
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the names of the network adapters that are members of the new team.
    Specify multiple network adapter names (or wildcard patterns) separated by a comma.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: TeamNicName
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the new team interface.
    This is the name used to reference the teamed network adapters.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "2"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: wi
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: NetLbfo.New-NetLbfoTeam
name: New-NetLbfoTeam
description: |-
  The **New-NetLbfoTeam** cmdlet creates a new NIC team that consists of one or more network adapters.
  Teaming network adapters of different speeds is not supported.
  You can create a team with network adapters of different speeds, but the network traffic distribution algorithms do not take the speed of each network adapter into consideration when distributing traffic.

  When you create a team, you can specify additional properties such as TeamingMode and LoadBalancingAlgorithm.

  You must have administrator rights to use **New-NetLbfoTeam**.
