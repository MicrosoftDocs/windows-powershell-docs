  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Default
  description: |+
    Indicates the customized parameters for overriding the defaults for main mode encryption, making it the new default setting for encryption. 
    For the **MainModeCryptoSet** object, the default *Name* parameter value becomes {E5A5D32A-4BCE-4e4d-B07F-4AB1BA7E5FE1}. 
    To retrieve default settings, query by using the default *Name* parameter value.
    To specify a different default cryptographic set, delete the current default set and use the Rename-NetIPsecMainModeCryptoSet cmdlet to specify the default set with {E5A5D32A-4BCE-4e4d-B07F-4AB1BA7E5FE1}.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Description
  description: |+
    Specifies that matching firewall rules of the indicated description are created.
    Wildcard characters are accepted. 
    This parameter provides information about the firewall rule.
    This parameter specifies the localized, user-facing description of the IPsec rule.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DisplayName
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies that only matching firewall rules of the indicated display name are created.
    Wildcard characters are accepted. 
    Specifies the localized, user-facing name of the firewall rule being created.
    When creating a rule this parameter is required.
    This parameter value is locale-dependent.
    If the object is not modified, this parameter value may change in certain circumstances.
    When writing scripts in multi-lingual environments, the *Name* parameter should be used instead, where the default value is a randomly assigned value. 
    This parameter cannot be set to All.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ForceDiffieHellman
  description: |+
    Indicates that matching main mode cryptographic sets of the indicated value are created. 
    If this parameter is set to True, then IPsec uses Diffie-Hellman exchanges to protect the main mode key exchange when AuthIP is used.
    AuthIP is specified by KeyModule.
    This provides stronger security for the key exchange. 
    The default value is False.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: GPOSession
  description: |+
    Specifies the network GPO from which to retrieve the rules to be created. 
    This parameter is used in the same way as the *PolicyStore* parameter.
    When modifying GPOs in Windows PowerShell®, each change to a GPO requires the entire GPO to be loaded, modified, and saved back.
    On a busy Domain Controller (DC), this can be a slow and resource-heavy operation.
    A GPO Session loads a domain GPO onto the local computer and makes all changes in a batch, before saving it back.
    This reduces the load on the DC and speeds up the Windows PowerShell cmdlets.
    To load a GPO Session, use the Open-NetGPO cmdlet.
    To save a GPO Session, use the Save-NetGPO cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Group
  description: |+
    Specifies that only matching firewall rules of the indicated group association are created.
    Wildcard characters are accepted. 
    This parameter specifies the source string for the *DisplayGroup* parameter.
    If the *DisplayGroup* parameter value is a localizable string, then this parameter contains an indirect string.
    Rule groups can be used to organize rules by influence and allows batch rule modifications.
    Using the Set-NetFirewallRule cmdlets, if the group name is specified for a set of rules or sets, then all of the rules or sets in that group receive the same set of modifications.
    It is good practice to specify this parameter value with a universal and world-ready indirect @FirewallAPI name. 
    The *DisplayGroup* parameter cannot be specified upon object creation using the New-NetFirewallRule cmdlet, but can be modified using dot-notation and the Set-NetFirewallRule cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MaxMinutes
  description: |+
    Specifies that matching main mode cryptographic sets of the indicated maximum lifetime, in minutes, are created. 
    This parameter specifies the number of minutes established for a main mode security association before it expires and must be renegotiated. 
    The acceptable values for this parameter are: 0 through 2879. 

    - A non-zero value specifies the desired minute lifetime. 
    - NotConfigured: Valid only when configuring a GPO.
    Removes the setting from the GPO, which results in the policy not changing the value on the computer when the policy is applied. 
    The default value is 4800 minutes (eight hours). 
    When managing a GPO, the default setting is NotConfigured.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MaxSessions
  description: |+
    Specifies that matching main mode cryptographic sets of the indicated maximum lifetime, in sessions, are created. 
    This parameter specifies the number of sessions established for a main mode security association before it expires and must be renegotiated.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are: 0 to 2147483647. 

    - A value of zero (0) specifies that there should be no maximum session lifetime. 
    - A non-zero value specifies the desired session number. 
    - NotConfigured: Valid only when configuring a GPO.
    Removes the setting from the GPO, which results in the policy not changing the value on the computer when the policy is applied. 
    The default value is zero (0) sessions. 
    When managing a GPO, the default setting is NotConfigured.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name
  description: |+
    Specifies that only matching main mode cryptographic sets of the indicated name are created.
    Wildcard characters are accepted. 
    This parameter acts just like a file name, in that only one rule with a given name may exist in a policy store at a time.
    During group policy processing and policy merge, rules that have the same name but come from multiple stores being merged, will overwrite one another so that only one exists.
    This overwriting behavior is desirable if the rules serve the same purpose.
    For instance, all of the firewall rules have specific names, so if an administrator can copy these rules to a GPO, and the rules will override the local versions on a local computer.
    GPOs can have precedence.
    So, if an administrator has a different or more specific rule the same name in a higher-precedence GPO, then it overrides other rules that exist. 
    The default value is a randomly assigned value. 
    When you want to override the defaults for main mode encryption, specify the customized parameters and set this parameter, making this parameter the new default setting for encryption.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ID
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PolicyStore
  description: |+
    Specifies the policy store from which to retrieve the sets to be created. 
    A policy store is a container for firewall and IPsec policy. 
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - PersistentStore: Sometimes called static rules, this store contains the persistent policy for the local computer.
    This policy is not from GPOs, and has been created manually or programmatically, during application installation, on the computer.
    Rules created in this store are attached to the ActiveStore and activated on the computer immediately. 
    - ActiveStore: This store contains the currently active policy, which is the sum of all policy stores that apply to the computer.
    This is the resultant set of policy (RSOP) for the local computer (the sum of all GPOs that apply to the computer), and the local stores (the PersistentStore, the Static Windows Service Hardening (WSH), and the Configurable WSH). 
    ---- GPOs are also policy stores.
    Computer GPOs can be specified as follows. 
    ------ `-PolicyStore hostname`. 
    ---- Active Directory GPOs can be specified as follows. 
    ------ `-PolicyStore domain.fqdn.com\GPO_Friendly_Namedomain.fqdn.comGPO_Friendly_Name`. 
    ------ Such as the following. 
    -------- `-PolicyStore localhost`
    -------- `-PolicyStore corp.contoso.com\FirewallPolicy`
    ---- Active Directory GPOs can be created using the **New-GPO** cmdlet or the Group Policy Management Console. 
    - RSOP: This read-only store contains the sum of all GPOs applied to the local computer. 
    - SystemDefaults: This read-only store contains the default state of firewall rules that ship with Windows Server® 2012. 
    - StaticServiceStore: This read-only store contains all the service restrictions that ship with Windows.
    Optional and product-dependent features are considered part of Windows Server 2012 for the purposes of WFAS. 
    - ConfigurableServiceStore: This read-write store contains all the service restrictions that are added for third-party services.
    In addition, network isolation rules that are created for Windows Store application containers will appear in this policy store. 
    The default value is PersistentStore. 
    Use the Any keyword to configure the profile as Private, Public, Domain in this store. 
    The Set-NetIPsecMainModeCryptoSet cmdlet cannot be used to add an object to a policy store.
    An object can only be added to a policy store at creation time with the Copy-NetIPsecMainModeCryptoSet cmdlet or with the New-NetIPsecMainModeCryptoSet cmdlet.

  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

description: |-
  The **New-NetIPsecMainModeCryptoSet** cmdlet creates a cryptographic set to be used to negotiate a main mode security association (SA).

  A main mode cryptographic set is an ordered list of cryptographic proposals.

  Each proposal in the set specifies a set of encryption, hashing, and key exchange algorithms to propose.
  Proposals can be created by running the New-NetIPsecMainModeCryptoProposal cmdlet.
  The main mode exchange will use the first proposal that the peer computers have in common.

  The default main mode cryptographic set is used with all IPsec rules.
  IPsec rules are specified by the *Default* parameter at creation time.
  Additional main mode cryptographic sets can be used with IPsec main mode rules for fully customized main mode negotiations.
