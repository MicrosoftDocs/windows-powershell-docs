parameters:
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AllowSetKey
  description: |+
    Specifies that the IPsec rule allows trusted intermediaries to override keying material.
    When this parameter is set to True, then the trusted intermediaries are allowed to dictate the cryptographic keying material used with an IPsec security association (SA). 
    It is possible that when this parameter is set to True at both ends, the computers will perform arbitration through SA negotiation so that one end sets the key while the other end watches the key. 
    The default value is False. 
    This parameter is only supported on Windows Server® 2012.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""

- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AllowWatchKey
  description: |+
    Specifies that the IPsec rule allows trusted intermediaries to notify of changes in keying material.
    When this parameter is set to True, then the trusted intermediaries are allowed to retrieve the cryptographic keying material associated with an IPsec SA, and to subscribe for notification of changes. 
    The default value is False. 
    This parameter is only supported on Windows Server 2012.

    Specifies that only matching firewall rules of the indicated display name are created.
    Wildcard characters are accepted. 
    Specifies the localized, user-facing name of the firewall rule being created.
    When creating a rule this parameter is required.
    This parameter value is locale-dependent.
    If the object is not modified, this parameter value may change in certain circumstances.
    When writing scripts in multi-lingual environments, the *IPsecRuleName* parameter should be used instead, where the default value is a randomly assigned value.

  name: Enabled
  description: |+
    Specifies that matching main mode rules of the indicated state are created. 
    This parameter specifies that the rule object is administratively enabled or administratively disabled.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - True: Specifies the rule is currently enabled. 
    - False: Specifies the rule is currently disabled.
    A disabled rule will not actively modify computer behavior, but the rule still exists on the computer so it can be re-enabled.

  name: EncryptedTunnelBypass
  description: |+
    Indicates that matching IPsec rules of the specified value are created. 
    This parameter specifies the encapsulation state for network traffic sent to a tunnel end point that is already IPsec protected.
    If this parameter is set to True, then the network traffic sent to a tunnel end point that is already IPsec protected does not have to be encapsulated again.
    This option can improve network performance in the case where network traffic that is already end-to-end protected by other IPsec rules. 
    The default value is False. 
    This parameter is only supported on firstref_server_7 and Windows Server 2012.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ForwardPathLifetime
  description: |+
    Specifies that matching IPsec rules of the specified path lifetime value are created. 
    This parameter specifies the session key lifetime for an IPsec rule, in minutes.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are: 78 through 172799.
    The default value is 0 minutes.
    This parameter is only supported on Windows Server 2012. 
    When managing a GPO, the default setting is NotConfigured.
    This parameter is case sensitive and NotConfigured can only be specified using dot-notation.

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: GPOSession
  description: |+
    Specifies the network GPO from which to retrieve the rules to be created. 
    This parameter is used in the same way as the *PolicyStore* parameter.
    When modifying GPOs in Windows PowerShell®, each change to a GPO requires the entire GPO to be loaded, modified, and saved back.
    On a busy Domain Controller (DC), this can be a slow and resource-heavy operation.
    A GPO Session loads a domain GPO onto the local computer and makes all changes in a batch, before saving it back.
    This reduces the load on the DC and speeds up the Windows PowerShell cmdlets.
    To load a GPO Session, use the Open-NetGPO cmdlet.
    To save a GPO Session, use the Save-NetGPO cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Group
  description: |+
    Specifies that only matching IPsec rules of the indicated group association are created.
    Wildcard characters are accepted. 
    This parameter specifies the source string for the *DisplayGroup* parameter.
    If the *DisplayGroup* parameter value is a localizable string, then this parameter contains an indirect string.
    Rule groups can be used to organize rules by influence and allows batch rule modifications.
    Using the Set-NetIPsecRule cmdlets, if the group name is specified for a set of rules or sets, then all of the rules or sets in that group receive the same set of modifications.
    It is good practice to specify this parameter value with a universal and world-ready indirect @FirewallAPI name. 
    The *DisplayGroup* parameter cannot be specified upon object creation using this cmdlet, but can be modified using dot-notation and the Set-NetIPsecRule cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None

  name: InboundSecurity
  description: |+
    Specifies that only matching IPsec rules of the indicated group association are created.
    Wildcard characters are accepted. 
    This parameter specifies the source string for the *DisplayGroup* parameter.
    If the *DisplayGroup* parameter value is a localizable string, then this parameter contains an indirect string.
    Rule groups can be used to organize rules by influence and allows batch rule modifications.
    Using the Set-NetIPsecRule cmdlets, if the group name is specified for a set of rules or sets, then all of the rules or sets in that group receive the same set of modifications.

  name: InterfaceAlias
  description: |+
    Specifies the alias of the interface that applies to the traffic. 
    Querying for rules with this parameter can only be performed using filter objects.

  name: InterfaceType
  description: |+
    Specifies that only network connections made through the indicated interface types are subject to the requirements of this rule.
    This parameter specifies different authentication requirements for each of the three main network types. 
    The acceptable values for this parameter are: Any, Wired, Wireless, or RemoteAccess.
    The default value is Any.
    Querying for rules with this parameter can only be performed using filter objects.
    See the Get-NetFirewallInterfaceTypeFilter cmdlet for more information.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  parameterValueGroup: Any, Wired, Wireless, RemoteAccess
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IPsecRuleName
  description: |+
    Specifies Indicates that only matching main mode cryptographic sets of the indicated name are created.
    Wildcard characters are accepted. 
    This parameter acts just like a file name, in that only one rule with a given name may exist in a policy store at a time.
    During group policy processing and policy merge, rules that have the same name but come from multiple stores being merged, will overwrite one another so that only one exists.
    This overwriting behavior is desirable if the rules serve the same purpose.
    For instance, all of the firewall rules have specific names, so if an administrator can copy these rules to a GPO, and the rules will override the local versions on a local computer.
    GPOs can have precedence.
    So, if an administrator has a different or more specific rule the same name in a higher-precedence GPO, then it overrides other rules that exist. 
    The default value is a randomly assigned value. 
    To override the defaults for main mode encryption, specify the customized parameters and set this parameter value, making this parameter the new default setting for encryption.

- type: <xref href="KeyModule" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: KeyModule
  description: |+
    Specifies that matching IPsec rules of the indicated key module are created. 
    This parameter specifies which keying modules to negotiate. 
    The acceptable values for this parameter are: Default, AuthIP, IKEv1, or IKEv2. 

    - Default: Equivalent to both IKEv1 and AuthIP.
    Required in order for the rule to be applied to computers running Windows versions prior to nextref_server_7. 
    ---- There are authorization and cryptographic methods that are only compatible with certain keying modules.
    This is a very advanced setting intended only for specific interoperability scenarios.
    Overriding this parameter value may result in traffic being sent in plain-text if the authentication and cryptographic settings are not supported by the keying modules there. 
    - AuthIP: Supported with phase 2 authentication. 
    - IKEv1: Supported with pre-shared key (PSK), Certificates, and Kerberos. 
    - IKEv2: Not supported with Kerberos, PSK, or NTLM. 
    Windows versions prior to Windows Server 2012 only support the Default configuration.

  description: |+
    Specifies that network packets with matching IP port numbers match this rule.
    This parameter value is the first end point of an IPsec rule. 
    The acceptable value is a port, range, or keyword and depends on the protocol. 
    If the *Protocol* parameter value is TCP or UDP, then the acceptable values for this parameter are: 
    - Port range: 0 through 65535.

  name: OutboundSecurity
  description: |+
    Specifies that matching IPsec rules of the indicated security policy are created. 
    This parameter determines the degree of enforcement for security on outbound traffic. 
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - None: No authentication is requested or required for connections that match the rule.
    It specifies that the local computer does not attempt authentication for any network connections that match this rule.
    This option is typically used to grant IPsec exemptions for network connections that do not need to be protected by IPsec, but would otherwise match other rules that could cause the connection to be dropped. 
    - Request: Authentication is requested for connections that match the rule.
    The local computer attempts to authenticate any outbound network connections that match this rule, but allows the connection if the authentication attempt fails. 
    - Require: Authentication is required for connections that match the rule.
    If the authentication is not successful, then the outbound network traffic is discarded.

    The default value is None.

  name: PolicyStore
  description: |+
    Specifies the policy store from which to retrieve the rules to be created. 
    A policy store is a container for firewall and IPsec policy. 
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - PersistentStore: Sometimes called static rules, this store contains the persistent policy for the local computer.
    This policy is not from GPOs, and has been created manually or programmatically (during application installation) on the computer.
    Rules created in this store are attached to the ActiveStore and activated on the computer immediately. 
    - ActiveStore: This store contains the currently active policy, which is the sum of all policy stores that apply to the computer.
    This is the resultant set of policy (RSOP) for the local computer (the sum of all GPOs that apply to the computer), and the local stores (the PersistentStore, the static Windows service hardening (WSH), and the configurable WSH).
    ---- GPOs are also policy stores.
    Computer GPOs can be specified as follows. 
    ------ `-PolicyStore hostname`. 
    ---- Active Directory GPOs can be specified as follows. 
    ------ `-PolicyStore domain.fqdn.com\GPO_Friendly_Namedomain.fqdn.comGPO_Friendly_Name`. 
    ------ Such as the following.

- type: <xref href="Profile" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Profile
  description: |+
    Specifies one or more profiles to which the rule is assigned.
    The rule is active on the local computer only when the specified profile is currently active.
    This relationship is many-to-many and can be indirectly modified by the user, by changing the Profiles field on instances of firewall rules.
    Only one profile is applied at a time. 
    The acceptable values for this parameter are: Any, Domain, Private, Public, or NotApplicable.
    The default is Any.
    Separate multiple entries with a comma and do not include any spaces.
    Use the keyword Any to configure the profile as Private, Public, Domain in the ConfigurableServiceStore.

  name: RemoteTunnelEndpoint
  description: |+
    Specifies the IP address of the computer or gateway device that secures traffic from computers that match the *LocalAddress* parameter value to computers that match the *RemoteAddress* parameter value.
    The traffic is being secured to this IP address to the device identified in the *LocalTunnelEndpoint* parameter.
    This parameter value must use the same type of IP address as the *LocalTunnelEndpoint* parameter, which is either IPv4 or IPv6. 
    Address keywords are not supported. 
    On Windows® 7, nextref_server_7, and Windows Server 2012, this value can also be Any.
    When applied to a client computer, this option supports connection via a tunnel to a remote gateway or host regardless of the IP address or address type of the local computer.

  name: RemoteTunnelHostname
  description: |+
    Specifies that matching IPsec rules of the specified second end point tunnel host name are created. 
    Specifies a fully qualified DNS name that resolves to a list of remote tunnel end points. 
    This parameter is only supported on Windows Server 2012. 
    This parameter can only be used with multiple remote tunnel end points.
    Specifying this parameter prevents a non-asymmetric tunnel mode IPsec rule from being created.
    Rule creation will fail when a single remote tunnel end point and this parameter are specified, or when *RemoteTunnelEndpoint* parameter is set to Any and this parameter is specified.

uid: NetSecurity.New-NetIPsecRule
name: New-NetIPsecRule
description: |-
  The **New-NetIPsecRule** cmdlet creates a transport-mode or tunnel-mode IPsec rule and adds it to the target computer.
  Some parameters are used to specify the conditions that must be matched for the rule to apply, such as the *LocalAddress* and the *RemoteAddress* parameters.
  Other parameters specify the way that the connection should be secured, such as the *InboundSecurity* and the *OutboundSecurity* parameters.
  Rules that already exist can be managed with the Get-NetIPsecRule and Set-NetIPsecRule cmdlets.

  In order for custom main mode and quick mode security negotiations to occur, appropriate authorization and cryptographic sets must be associated with the rule.
  See the New-NetIPsecPhase1AuthSet, New-NetIPsecPhase2AuthSet, and New-NetIPsecQuickModeCryptoSet cmdlets for more information.

  Each authentication or cryptographic set must be created in the policy store for the associated IPsec rule.
  If a particular set applies to multiple IPsec rules in different policy stores (GPOs), then the set must be duplicated for each of those stores (so that policies can be updated without linking issues).
  See the Copy-NetFirewallRule, Copy-NetIPsecMainModeCryptoSet, Copy-NetIPsecMainModeRule, Copy-NetIPsecPhase1AuthSet, Copy-NetIPsecPhase2AuthSet, and Copy-NetIPsecQuickModeCryptoSet cmdlets and this cmdlet for more information.
