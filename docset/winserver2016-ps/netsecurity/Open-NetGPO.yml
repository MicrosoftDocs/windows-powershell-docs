- title: EXAMPLE 2
  code: |-
    PS C:\>$domain = "corp.contoso.com"



    PS C:\>$gpo = "corp.contoso.com\FirewallPolicy"



    PS C:\>$pdc = Get-ADDomainController -Discover -Service PrimaryDC -DomainName $domain



    PS C:\>$session = Open-NetGPO -PolicyStore $gpo -DomainController $pdc.Hostname

    This example shows targeting and opening a writeable DC.
    This ensures that the batch modifications are made when the GPO is closed.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete.

  defaultValue: None

  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimSession" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    Specifies the DC used to target the GPO.
    If this cmdlet is used without specifying this parameter, then the DC can target a read-only DC (RODC), and lose the batch changes with Save-NetGPO.
    To help target a writeable DC, use the cmdlets in the Active Directory module using the [Get-Command](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=113309) cmdlet with the *Module* parameter set to ActiveDirectory.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PolicyStore
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the policy store from which to retrieve the rules to be stored.
    A policy store is a container for firewall and IPsec policy.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - PersistentStore: Sometimes called static rules, this store contains the persistent policy for the local computer.
    This policy is not from GPOs, and has been created manually or programmatically (during application installation) on the computer.
    Rules created in this store are attached to the ActiveStore and activated on the computer immediately.
    - ActiveStore: This store contains the currently active policy, which is the sum of all policy stores that apply to the computer.
    This is the resultant set of policy (RSOP) for the local computer (the sum of all GPOs that apply to the computer), and the local stores (the PersistentStore, the static Windows service hardening (WSH), and the configurable WSH).
    ---- GPOs are also policy stores.
    Computer GPOs can be specified as follows.
    ----- `-PolicyStore hostname`.
    ---- Active Directory GPOs can be specified as follows.
    ----- `-PolicyStore domain.fqdn.com\GPO_Friendly_Namedomain.fqdn.comGPO_Friendly_Name`.
    ----- Such as the following.
    ------- `-PolicyStore localhost`
    ------- `-PolicyStore corp.contoso.com\FirewallPolicy`
    ---- Active Directory GPOs can be created using the **New-GPO** cmdlet or the Group Policy Management Console.
    - RSOP: This read-only store contains the sum of all GPOs applied to the local computer.
    - SystemDefaults: This read-only store contains the default state of firewall rules that ship with Windows Server 2012.
    - StaticServiceStore: This read-only store contains all the service restrictions that ship with Windows Server 2012.
    Optional and product-dependent features are considered part of Windows Server 2012 for the purposes of WFAS.
    - ConfigurableServiceStore: This read-write store contains all the service restrictions that are added for third-party services.
    In addition, network isolation rules that are created for Windows Store application containers will appear in this policy store.
    The default value is PersistentStore.
    The Set-NetIPsecRule cmdlet cannot be used to add an object to a policy store.
    An object can only be added to a policy store at creation time with this Copy-NetIPsecRule cmdlet or with the New-NetIPsecRule cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell&reg; calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: NetSecurity.Open-NetGPO
name: Open-NetGPO
description: |-
  The **Open-NetGPO** cmdlet caches the Group Policy Object (GPO) so that modifications can be made locally.
  The changes are batch returned to the policy store with the Save-NetGPO cmdlet.

  If the *DomainController* parameter value is not a writeable Domain Controller (DC), then the batch updates will not be applied.
  To help target a writeable DC, use the cmdlets in the Active Directory module using the [Get-Command](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=113309) cmdlet with the *Module* parameter set to ActiveDirectory.

  An error will result for using this cmdlet when the user is not a domain administrator.
