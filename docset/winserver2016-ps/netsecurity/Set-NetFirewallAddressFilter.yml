parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job.
    Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 
    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt.
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes.
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets.
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 
    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="CimSession" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/cimcmdlets/new-cimsession) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: GPOSession
  description: |+
    Targets the network GPO from which to retrieve the rules to be modified. 
    This parameter is used in the same way as the *PolicyStore* parameter.
    When modifying GPOs in Windows PowerShellÂ®, each change to a GPO requires the entire GPO to be loaded, modified, and saved back.
    On a busy Domain Controller (DC), this can be a slow and resource-heavy operation.
    A GPO Session loads a domain GPO onto the local computer and makes all changes in a batch, before saving it back.
    This reduces the load on the DC and speeds up the Windows PowerShell cmdlets.
    To load a GPO Session, use the **Open-NetGPO** cmdlet.
    To save a GPO Session, use the **Save-NetGPO** cmdlet.

  name: LocalAddress
  description: |+
    Specifies that network packets with matching IP addresses match this rule. 
    This parameter value is the first end point of an IPsec rule and specifies the computers that are subject to the requirements of this rule. 
    This parameter value is an IPv4 or IPv6 address, hostname, subnet, range, or the following keyword: Any. 
    The acceptable formats for this parameter are: 
    - Single IPv4 Address: 1.2.3.4 
    - Single IPv6 Address: fe80::1 
    - IPv4 Subnet (by network bit count): 1.2.3.4/24 
    - IPv6 Subnet (by network bit count): fe80::1/48 
    - IPv4 Subnet (by network mask):  1.2.3.4/255.255.255.0 
    - IPv4 Range: 1.2.3.4 through 1.2.3.7 
    - IPv6 Range: fe80::1 through fe80::9 

    > [!NOTE]
    > Querying for rules with this parameter can only be performed using filter objects. See the **Get-NetFirewallAddressFilter** cmdlet for more information.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PolicyStore
  description: |+
    Targets the policy store from which to retrieve the rules to be modified. 
    A policy store is a container for firewall and IPsec policy. 
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - PersistentStore: Sometimes called static rules, this store contains the persistent policy for the local computer.
    This policy is not from GPOs, and has been created manually or programmatically (during application installation) on the computer.
    Rules created in this store are attached to the ActiveStore and activated on the computer immediately. 
    - ActiveStore: This store contains the currently active policy, which is the sum of all policy stores that apply to the computer.
    This is the resultant set of policy (RSOP) for the local computer (the sum of all GPOs that apply to the computer), and the local stores (the PersistentStore, the static Windows service hardening (WSH), and the configurable WSH). 
        - GPOs are also policy stores.
    Computer GPOs can be specified as follows. 
                - `-PolicyStore hostname`. 
        - Active Directory GPOs can be specified as follows. 
                - `-PolicyStore domain.fqdn.com\GPO_Friendly_Namedomain.fqdn.comGPO_Friendly_Name`. 
                - Such as the following. 
                        - `-PolicyStore localhost`
                        - `-PolicyStore corp.contoso.com\FirewallPolicy`
        - Active Directory GPOs can be created using the **New-GPO** cmdlet or the Group Policy Management Console. 
    - RSOP: This read-only store contains the sum of all GPOs applied to the local computer. 
    - SystemDefaults: This read-only store contains the default state of firewall rules that ship with Windows ServerÂ® 2012. 
    - StaticServiceStore: This read-only store contains all the service restrictions that ship with Windows Server 2012.
    Optional and product-dependent features are considered part of Windows Server 2012 for the purposes of WFAS. 
    - ConfigurableServiceStore: This read-write store contains all the service restrictions that are added for third-party services.
    In addition, network isolation rules that are created for Windows Store application containers will appear in this policy store. 
    The default value is PersistentStore. 
    The **Set-NetFirewallRule** cmdlet cannot be used to add an object to a policy store.
    An object can only be added to a policy store at creation time with the **Copy-NetFirewallRule** or with the **New-NetFirewallRule** cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: RemoteAddress
  description: |+
    Specifies that network packets with matching IP addresses match this rule. 
    This parameter value is the second end point of an IPsec rule and specifies the computers that are subject to the requirements of this rule. 
    This parameter value is an IPv4 or IPv6 address, hostname, subnet, range, or the following keyword: Any. 
    The acceptable formats for this parameter are: 
    - Single IPv4 Address: 1.2.3.4 
    - Single IPv6 Address: fe80::1 
    - IPv4 Subnet (by network bit count): 1.2.3.4/24 
    - IPv6 Subnet (by network bit count): fe80::1/48 
    - IPv4 Subnet (by network mask): 1.2.3.4/255.255.255.0 
    - IPv4 Range: 1.2.3.4 through 1.2.3.7 
    - IPv6 Range: fe80::1 through fe80::9

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: NetSecurity.Set-NetFirewallAddressFilter
name: Set-NetFirewallAddressFilter
description: |-
  The **Set-NetFirewallAddressFilter** cmdlet modifies the local and remote addresses associated with the input rules.

  See the **Get-NetFirewallAddressFilter** cmdlet for more information on address filters.

  To modify rule address conditions, two methods can be used starting with the address filters returned by the **Get-NetFirewallAddressFilter** cmdlet and optional additional querying. 
  The address filter objects can be piped to the **Get-NetFirewallRule**, **Get-NetIPsecRule**, or **Get-NetIPsecMainModeRule** cmdlet, which returns the rule objects associated with the filters.
  These rules are then piped to the **Set-NetFirewallRule**, **Set-NetIPsecRule**, or **Set-NetIPsecMainModeRule** cmdlet, where the address properties can be configured. 
  Alternatively, piping the address filter objects directly to this cmdlet allows the *LocalAddress* and *RemoteAddress* parameters of the rules to be specified.
