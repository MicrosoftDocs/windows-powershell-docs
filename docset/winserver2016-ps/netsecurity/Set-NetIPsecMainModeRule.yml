  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Description
  description: |+
    Specifies that matching main mode rules of the indicated description are modified.
    Wildcard characters are accepted. 
    This parameter provides information about the main mode rule.
    This parameter specifies the localized, user-facing description of the IPsec rule.

  name: DisplayGroup
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies that only matching main mode rules of the indicated group association are modified.
    Wildcard characters are accepted. 
    The *Group* parameter specifies the source string for this parameter.
    If the value for this parameter is a localizable string, then the *Group* parameter contains an indirect string.
    Rule groups can be used to organize rules by influence and allows batch rule modifications.
    Using this cmdlet, if the group name is specified for a set of rules or sets, then all of the rules or sets in that group receive the same set of modifications.
    It is good practice to specify the *Group* parameter value with a universal and world-ready indirect @FirewallAPI name. 
     parameter cannot be specified upon object creation using the New-NetIPsecMainModeRule cmdlet, but can be modified using dot-notation and this cmdlet.

  description: |+
    Specifies that only matching main mode rules of the indicated display name are modified.
    Wildcard characters are accepted. 
    Specifies the localized, user-facing name of the main mode rule being created.
    When creating a rule this parameter is required.
    This parameter value is locale-dependent.
    If the object is not modified, this parameter value may change in certain circumstances.
    When writing scripts in multi-lingual environments, the *Name* parameter should be used instead, where the default value is a randomly assigned value.
    This parameter cannot be set to All.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Enabled" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Enabled
  description: |+
    Specifies that matching main mode rules of the indicated state are modified. 
    This parameter specifies that the rule object is administratively enabled or administratively enabled.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - True: Specifies the rule is currently enabled. 
    - False: Specifies the rule is currently disabled.
    A disabled rule will not actively modify computer behavior, but the management construct still exists on the computer so it can be re-enabled.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: True, False
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: GPOSession
  description: |+
    Specifies the network GPO from which to retrieve the rules to be modified. 
    This parameter is used in the same way as the *PolicyStore* parameter.
    When modifying GPOs in Windows PowerShell®, each change to a GPO requires the entire GPO to be loaded, modified, and saved back.
    On a busy Domain Controller (DC), this can be a slow and resource-heavy operation.
    A GPO Session loads a domain GPO onto the local computer and makes all changes in a batch, before saving it back.
    This reduces the load on the DC and speeds up the Windows PowerShell cmdlets.
    To load a GPO Session, use the Open-NetGPO cmdlet.
    To save a GPO Session, use the Save-NetGPO cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None

  name: Group
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies that only matching main mode rules of the indicated group association are modified.
    Wildcard characters are accepted. 
    This parameter specifies the source string for the *DisplayGroup* parameter.
    If the *DisplayGroup* parameter value is a localizable string, then this parameter contains an indirect string.
    Rule groups can be used to organize rules by influence and allows batch rule modifications.
    Using this cmdlets, if the group name is specified for a set of rules or sets, then all of the rules or sets in that group receive the same set of modifications.
    It is good practice to specify this parameter value with a universal and world-ready indirect @FirewallAPI name. 
    The *DisplayGroup* parameter cannot be specified upon object creation using the New-NetIPsecMainModeRule cmdlet, but can be modified using dot-notation and this cmdlet.

  name: LocalAddress
  description: |+
    Specifies that network packets with matching IP addresses match this rule. 
    This parameter value is the first end point of an IPsec rule and specifies the computers that are subject to the requirements of this rule. 
    This parameter value is an IPv4 or IPv6 address, hostname, subnet, range, or the following keyword: Any. 
    The acceptable formats for this parameter are: 
    - Single IPv4 Address: 1.2.3.4 
    - Single IPv6 Address: fe80::1 
    - IPv4 Subnet (by network bit count): 1.2.3.4/24 
    - IPv6 Subnet (by network bit count): fe80::1/48 
    - IPv4 Subnet (by network mask): 1.2.3.4/255.255.255.0 
    - IPv4 Range: 1.2.3.4 through 1.2.3.7 
    - IPv6 Range: fe80::1 through fe80::9 
    Querying for rules with this parameter can only be performed using filter objects.
    See the Get-NetFirewallAddressFilter cmdlet for more information.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MainModeCryptoSet
  description: |+
    Gets the IPsec main mode rules that are associated with the given main mode cryptographic set to be modified. 
    Specifies, by Name, the main mode cryptographic set to be associated with the main mode rule. 
    A NetIPsecMainModeCryptoSet object represents a main mode cryptographic conditions associated with a main mode rule.
    This parameter sets the methods for main mode negotiation by describing the proposals for encryption.
    This is only associated with main mode rules.
    See the Get-NetIPsecMainModeCryptoSet cmdlet for more information.
    Alternatively, the *AssociatedNetIPsecMainModeCryptoSet* parameter can be used for the same purpose, but is used to pipe the input set into the rule.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies that only matching main mode rules of the indicated name are modified.
    Wildcard characters are accepted. 
    This parameter acts just like a file name, in that only one rule with a given name may exist in a policy store at a time.
    During group policy processing and policy merge, rules that have the same name but come from multiple stores being merged, will overwrite one another so that only one exists.
    This overwriting behavior is desirable if the rules serve the same purpose.
    For instance, all of the firewall rules have specific names, so if an administrator can copy these rules to a GPO, and the rules will override the local versions on a local computer.
    GPOs can have precedence.
    So, if an administrator has a different or more specific rule the same name in a higher-precedence GPO, then it overrides other rules that exist. 
    The default value is a randomly assigned value. 
    When you want to override the defaults for main mode encryption, specify the customized parameters and set this parameter value, making this parameter the new default setting for encryption.

  name: Phase1AuthSet
  description: |+
    Gets the main mode rules that are associated with the given phase 1 authentication set to be modified. 
    This parameter specifies, by name, the Phase 1 authentication set to be associated with the main mode rule. 
    A **NetIPsecPhase1AuthSet** object represents the phase 1 authentication conditions associated with an IPsec or main mode rule.
    This parameter sets the methods for main mode negotiation by describing the proposals for computer authentication.
    See the New-NetIPsecAuthProposal cmdlet of more information.
    Alternatively, the *AssociatedNetIPsecPhase1AuthSet* parameter can be used for the same purpose, but is used to pipe the input set into the rule.

  name: Platform
  description: |+
    Specifies which version of Windows the associated rule applies. 
    The acceptable format for this parameter is a number in the Major.Minor format. 
    The version number of 6.0 corresponds to Vista (nextref_vista), 6.1 corresponds to Win7 (Windows® 7 or firstref_longhorn), and 6.2 corresponds to Win8 (Windows® 8 or Windows Server 2012). 
    If + is not specified, then only that version is associated. 
    If + is specified, then that version and later are associated. 
    Querying for rules with this parameter with the Get-NetIPsecMainModeRule cmdlet cannot be performed.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PolicyStore
  description: |+
    Specifies the policy store from which to retrieve the rules to be modified. 
    A policy store is a container for firewall and IPsec policy. 
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - PersistentStore: Sometimes called static rules, this store contains the persistent policy for the local computer.
    This policy is not from GPOs, and has been created manually or programmatically (during application installation) on the computer.
    Rules created in this store are attached to the ActiveStore and activated on the system immediately. 
    - ActiveStore: This store contains the currently active policy, which is the sum of all policy stores that apply to the computer.
    This is the resultant set of policy (RSOP) for the local computer (the sum of all GPOs that apply to the computer), and the local stores (the PersistentStore, the static Windows service hardening (WSH), and the configurable WSH). 
    ---- GPOs are also policy stores.
    Computer GPOs can be specified as follows. 
    ------ `-PolicyStore hostname`. 
    ---- Active Directory GPOs can be specified as follows. 
    ------ `-PolicyStore domain.fqdn.com\GPO_Friendly_Namedomain.fqdn.comGPO_Friendly_Name`. 
    ------ Such as the following. 
    -------- `-PolicyStore localhost`
    -------- `-PolicyStore corp.contoso.com\FirewallPolicy`
    ---- Active Directory GPOs can be created using the **New-GPO** cmdlet or the Group Policy Management Console. 
    - RSOP: This read-only store contains the sum of all GPOs applied to the local computer. 
    - SystemDefaults: This read-only store contains the default state of main mode rules that ship with Windows Server® 2012. 
    - StaticServiceStore: This read-only store contains all the service restrictions that ship with Windows Server 2012.
    Optional and product-dependent features are considered part of Windows Server 2012 for the purposes of WFAS. 
    - ConfigurableServiceStore: This read-write store contains all the service restrictions that are added for third-party services.
    In addition, network isolation rules that are created for Windows Store application containers will appear in this policy store. 
    The default value is PersistentStore. 
    This cmdlet cannot be used to add an object to a policy store.
    An object can only be added to a policy store at creation time with the Copy-NetIPsecMainModeRule cmdlet or with the New-NetIPsecMainModeRule cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Profile" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Profile
  description: |+
    Specifies one or more profiles to which the rule is assigned.
    The rule is active on the local computer only when the specified profile is currently active.
    This relationship is many-to-many and can be indirectly modified by the user, by changing the Profiles field on instances of firewall rules.
    Only one profile is applied at a time. 
    The acceptable values for this parameter are: Any, Domain, Private, Public, or NotApplicable.
    The default value is Any. 
    Separate multiple entries with a comma and do not include any spaces. 
    Use the keyword Any to configure the profile as Private, Public, Domain in the ConfigurableServiceStore.

  description: |+
    Specifies that network packets with matching IP addresses match this rule. 
    This parameter value is the second end point of an IPsec rule and specifies the computers that are subject to the requirements of this rule. 
    This parameter value is an IPv4 or IPv6 address, hostname, subnet, range, or the following keyword: Any. 
    The acceptable formats for this parameter are: 
    - Single IPv4 Address: 1.2.3.4 
    - Single IPv6 Address: fe80::1 
    - IPv4 Subnet (by network bit count): 1.2.3.4/24 
    - IPv6 Subnet (by network bit count): fe80::1/48

  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

description: |-
  The **Set-NetIPsecMainModeRule** cmdlet modifies firewall properties of existing main mode rules.
  This cmdlet gets one or more main mode rules to be modified with the *Name* parameter (default), the *DisplayName* parameter, or by group association using the *DisplayGroup* or *Group* parameters.
  The rules cannot be queried by property in this cmdlet.
  The Get-NetIPsecMainModeRule cmdlet returns the queried objects and pipes the objects into this cmdlet.
  The remaining parameters specify the properties of the rule to be modified.
  When the *DisplayGroup* or *Group* parameter is specified, then all of the sets associated with the group receive the same modifications.
  The rule parameters modified using the dot-notation are committed using this cmdlet.

  To move a rule to a new GPO, copy the existing rule by running the Copy-NetIPsecMainModeRule cmdlet with the *NewPolicyStore* parameter, then removing the old rule with the Remove-NetIPsecMainModeRule cmdlet.

  Modifying authentication or cryptographic configurations to use the default settings including NetIPsecPhase1AuthSet, NetIPsecMainModeCryptoSet, or with Default flag enabled must be done by using dot-notation
