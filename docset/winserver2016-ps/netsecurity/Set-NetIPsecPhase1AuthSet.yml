parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimSession" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Description
  description: |+
    Specifies that matching phase 1 authentication sets of the indicated description are modified.
    Wildcard characters are accepted. 
    This parameter provides information about the phase 1 authentication rule.
    This parameter specifies a localized, user-facing description of the object.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: DisplayGroup
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies that only matching phase 1 authentication sets of the indicated group association are modified.
    Wildcard characters are accepted. 
    The  *Group* parameter specifies the source string for this parameter.
    If the value for this parameter is a localizable string, then the  *Group* parameter contains an indirect string.
    Rule groups can be used to organize rules by influence and allows batch rule modifications.
    Using this cmdlet, if the group name is specified for a set of rules, then all of the rules in that group receive the same set of modifications.
    It is good practice to specify the  *Group* parameter with a universal  and world-ready indirect @FirewallAPI name. 
    This parameter cannot be specified upon object creation using the New-NetIPsecPhase1AuthSet cmdlet, but can be modified using dot notation and this cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: DisplayName
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies that only matching phase 1 authentication sets of the indicated display name are modified.
    Wildcard characters are accepted. 
    This parameter specifies the localized, user-facing name of the phase 1 authentication set being created.
    When creating a set this parameter is required.
    This parameter value is locale-dependent.
    If the object is not modified, this parameter value may change in certain circumstances.
    When writing scripts in multi-lingual environments, the *Name* parameter should be used instead, where the default value is a randomly assigned value. 
    This parameter value cannot be All.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: GPOSession
  description: |+
    Specifies the network GPO from which to retrieve the sets to be modified. 
    This parameter is used in the same way as the *PolicyStore* parameter.
    When modifying Group Policy Objects (GPOs) in Windows PowerShell®, each change to a GPO requires the entire GPO to be loaded, modified, and saved back.
    On a busy Domain Controller (DC), this can be a slow and resource-heavy operation.
    A GPO Session loads a domain GPO onto the local computer and makes all changes in a batch, before saving it back.
    This reduces the load on the DC and speeds up the Windows PowerShell cmdlets.
    To load a GPO Session, use the Open-NetGPO cmdlet.
    To save a GPO Session, use the Save-NetGPO cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Group
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies that only matching phase 1 authentication sets of the indicated group association are modified.
    Wildcard characters are accepted. 
    This parameter specifies the source string for the *DisplayGroup* parameter.
    If the *DisplayGroup* parameter value is a localizable string, then this parameter contains an indirect string.
    Rule groups organizes rules by influence and allows batch rule modifications.
    Using this cmdlet, if the group name is specified for a set of rules, then all of the rules in that group receive the same set of modifications.
    It is good practice to specify this parameter with a universal and world-ready indirect @FirewallAPI name. 
    The *DisplayGroup* parameter cannot be specified upon object creation using the New-NetIPsecPhase1AuthSet cmdlet, but can be modified using dot notation and this cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimInstance" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: InputObject
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the input object that is used in a pipeline command.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies that only matching phase 1 authentication sets of the indicated name are modified.
    Wildcard characters are accepted. 
    This parameter acts just like a file name, in that only one rule with a given name may exist in a policy store at a time.
    During group policy processing and policy merge, rules that have the same name but come from multiple stores being merged, will overwrite one another so that only one exists.
    This overwriting behavior is desirable if the rules serve the same purpose.
    For instance, all of the firewall rules have specific names, so if an administrator can copy these rules to a GPO, and the rules will override the local versions on a local computer.
    Since GPOs can have precedence, if an administrator that gives a rule with a different or more specific rule the same name in a higher-precedence GPO, then it overrides other rules that exist. 
    The default value is a randomly assigned value. 
    When the defaults for phase 1 encryption are overridden, specify the customized parameters and set this parameter value, making this parameter the new default setting for encryption.

  name: NewDisplayName
  description: |+
    Specifies the new display name for an IPsec rule.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PassThru
  description: |+
    Returns an object representing the item with which you are working.
    By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PolicyStore
  description: |+
    Specifies the policy store from which to retrieve the sets to be modified. 
    A policy store is a container for firewall and IPsec policy. 
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - PersistentStore: Sometimes called static rules, this store contains the persistent policy for the local computer.
    This policy is not from GPOs, and has been created manually or programmatically (during application installation) on the computer.
    Rules created in this store are attached to the ActiveStore and activated on the computer immediately. 
    - ActiveStore: This store contains the currently active policy, which is the sum of all policy stores that apply to the computer.
    This is the resultant set of policy (RSOP) for the local computer (the sum of all GPOs that apply to the computer), and the local stores (the PersistentStore, the static Windows service hardening (WSH), and the configurable WSH). 
    ---- Group Policy Objects (GPOs) are also policy stores.
    Computer GPOs can be specified as follows. 
    ------ `-PolicyStore hostname`. 
    ---- Active Directory GPOs can be specified as follows. 
    ------ `-PolicyStore domain.fqdn.com\GPO_Friendly_Namedomain.fqdn.comGPO_Friendly_Name`. 
    ------ Such as the following. 
    -------- `-PolicyStore localhost`
    -------- `-PolicyStore corp.contoso.com\FirewallPolicy`
    ---- Active Directory GPOs can be created using the **New-GPO** cmdlet or the Group Policy Management Console. 
    - RSOP: This read-only store contains the sum of all GPOs applied to the local computer. 
    - SystemDefaults: This read-only store contains the default state of firewall rules that ship with Windows Server® 2012. 
    - StaticServiceStore: This read-only store contains all the service restrictions that ship with Windows Server 2012.
    Optional and product-dependent features are considered part of Windows Server 2012 for the purposes of WFAS. 
    - ConfigurableServiceStore: This read-write store contains all the service restrictions that are added for third-party services.
    In addition, network isolation rules that are created for Windows Store application containers will appear in this policy store. 
    The default value is PersistentStore. 
    This cmdlet cannot be used to add an object to a policy store.
    An object can only be added to a policy store at creation time with the New-NetIPsecPhase1AuthSet cmdlet or with the Copy-NetIPsecPhase1AuthSet cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None

  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimInstance" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Proposal
  description: |+
    Associates the specified cryptographic proposal to the corresponding cryptographic set to be used in main mode negotiations.
    Separate multiple entries with a comma.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"

description: |-
  The **Set-NetIPsecPhase2AuthSet** cmdlet modifies cryptographic set properties of existing main mode cryptographic sets.

  This cmdlet returns one or more phase 1 authentication sets to be modified with the *Name* (default), *DisplayName* or by association using the *DisplayGroup*, or *Group* cmdlet.
  The sets cannot be queried by property in this cmdlet.
  The Get-NetIPsecPhase1AuthSet cmdlet returns queried rules and pipes the rules into this cmdlet.
  The remaining parameters specify the properties of this cmdlet to be modified.
  When a group is specified, all of the sets associated with the group receive the same modifications.
  The rule parameters modified using the dot-notation are committed with this cmdlet.

  To move a set to a new GPO, copy the existing set by running the Copy-NetIPsecPhase1AuthSet cmdlet with the *NewPolicyStore* parameter, then remove the old set by running the Remove-NetIPsecPhase1AuthSet cmdlet.
