  This reference provides cmdlet descriptions and syntax for all Network Switch Team-specific cmdlets. It lists the cmdlets in alphabetical order based on the verb at the beginning of the cmdlet.

  These Network Switch Team cmdlets should only be used with NIC switch teams that are manipulated by a forwarding extension in the Hyper-V Extensible Switch.

  > [!NOTE]
  > For any Windows Client editions, these NetSwitchTeam cmdlets can be used only for remote management of the Hyper-V Extensible Switch that is running on Windows Server editions. Windows Client editions do not support running the Hyper-V Extensible Switch on the client itself.
