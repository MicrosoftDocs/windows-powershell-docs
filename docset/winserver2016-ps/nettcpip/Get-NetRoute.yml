examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Get all routes'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Get-NetRoute | Format-List -Property *
  description: |-
    This command gets all the routes for the computer, and then passes them to the Format-List cmdlet by using the pipeline operator.
    The **Format-List** cmdlet displays all the properties of an object.
    For more information, type `Get-Help Format-List`.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 2: Get all IPv6 routes'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Get-NetRoute -AddressFamily IPv6
  description: |-
    This command gets the routes that belong to the IPv6 address family.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 3: Get routes for a specified interface'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Get-NetRoute -InterfaceIndex 12
  description: |-
    This command gets the IP routes associated with the interface that has an index of 12.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 4: Get the next hop for the default route'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Get-NetRoute -DestinationPrefix "0.0.0.0/0" | Select-Object -ExpandProperty "NextHop"
  description: |-
    This command gets the next hop for the default route.
    The next hop gateway for the default route is also known as the default gateway.
    The command gets the default IP routes, and passes them to the Select-Object cmdlet.
    That cmdlet displays the **NextHop** property for each default route.
    For more information about displaying selected properties, type `Get-Help Select-Object`.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 5: Get IP routes to non-local destinations'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Get-NetRoute | Where-Object -FilterScript { $_.NextHop -Ne "::" } | Where-Object -FilterScript { $_.NextHop -Ne "0.0.0.0" } | Where-Object -FilterScript { ($_.NextHop.SubString(0,6) -Ne "fe80::") }
  description: |-
    This command gets IP routes that have next hops that are not in the local subnet.
    The command gets all routes, and then passes them to a series of Where-Object commands by using the pipeline operator.
    The command uses different filter scripts to discard routes that are the default gateway for the two IP address families and the IPv6 addresses that begin with fe80.
    For more information about filtering by using **Where-Object**, type `Get-Help Where-Object`.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 6: Get network adapters that have IP routes to non-local destinations'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Get-NetRoute | Where-Object -FilterScript {$_.NextHop -Ne "::"} | Where-Object -FilterScript { $_.NextHop -Ne "0.0.0.0" } | Where-Object -FilterScript { ($_.NextHop.SubString(0,6) -Ne "fe80::") } | Get-NetAdapter
  description: |-
    This command gets network adapters that have IP routes that have next hops that are not in the local subnet.
    As in the previous example, the command gets the routes that have next hop values by using the **Get-NetRoute** and the Where-Object cmdlets, and then passes those routes to the **Get-NetAdapter** cmdlet by using the pipeline operator.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 7: Get IP routes that have an infinite valid lifetime'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Get-NetRoute | Where-Object -FilterScript { $_.ValidLifetime -Eq ([TimeSpan]::MaxValue) }
  description: |-
    This command gets all IP routes, and then passes them to the Where-Object cmdlet by using the pipeline operator.
    The command selects those routes that have a valid lifetime of the maximum value.
