    $probe=New-Object Microsoft.Windows.NetworkController.LoadBalancerProbeProperties
    $probe.protocol="HTTP"
    $probe.port="80"
    $probe.RequestPath="/health.htm"

  description: ""
  summary: |+
    This example creates a new health probe named probe1 for a load balancer resource named lb1.
    This is a HTTP probe that queries to the RequestPath of "/health.htm".
    The query is performed every 5 seconds, as specified by the IntervalInSeconds property.
    The health probe must receive an HTTP response code of 200 for 8 consecutive queries for the probe to consider the backend IP to be healthy.
    If the backend IP is not healthy, the load balancer will not send traffic to the IP.

  name: CertificateThumbPrint
  description: |+
    Specifies the digital public key X.509 certificate of a user account that has permission to perform this action.
    This is the certificate thumbprint of the certificate.
    This thumbprint must also be provided in the ClientCertificateThumbprint parameter in the Install-NetworkController or Set-NetworkController cmdlet so that Network Controller can authorize this user.
