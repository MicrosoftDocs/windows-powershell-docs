  code: |-
    PS C:\> New-NetworkControllerNodeObject -Name "Node1" -Server "NCNode1.contoso.com" -FaultDomain "fd:/rack1/host1" -RestInterface "Ethernet"
  description: |-
    This command creates a network controller node object named Node1.
    The fully qualified domain name of the computer is NCNode1.contoso.com and the interface on the computer listening to REST requests is named Ethernet.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: FaultDomain
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the servers that are likely to experience failure at the same time due to shared physical dependencies such as power and networking sources.

    Fault domains typically represent hierarchies that are related to these shared dependencies, with more servers likely to fail together from a higher point in the fault domain tree.
    During runtime, a network controller considers the fault domains in the cluster and attempts to spread out the network controller services so that they are in separate fault domains.
    This process helps ensure, in case of failure of any one fault domain, that the availability of that service and its state is not compromised.

    Fault domains are specified in a hierarchical format.
    For example: /DC1/Rack1/Host1, where DC1 is the datacenter name, Rack1 is the rack name and Host1 is the name of the host where the node is placed.

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the computer to be added to the deployment.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="X509Certificate2" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: NodeCertificate
  description: |+
    Specifies the certificate used for authenticating the computer.
    You only need to specify this parameter if the cluster is using certificate based authentication.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RestInterface
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the interface on the node that will receive requests from the representational state transfer (REST) clients.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Server
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the fully qualified domain name (FQDN), IP address, or hostname of the computer to be added to the deployment.
    If Kerberos authentication is being used for cluster authentication, FQDN must be provided.

  The **New-NetworkControllerNodeObject** cmdlet creates a network controller node object.
  This cmdlet is used for configuring a network controller for the first time.
  The object created from this cmdlet is passed to the **Install-NetworkControllerCluster** cmdlet to create a network controller cluster.

  The steps for configuring a network controller are: 

  - Install the network controller role on all the computers that will be functioning as a network controller in your deployment.
  - From one of those computers (or any other remote computer), run the **New-NetworkControllerNodeObject** cmdlet to enter the details of the node to be part of the deployment.
  Repeat this step for all the computers that are part of the deployment.
  These node objects will be passed as a parameter to the next cmdlet. 
  - Run the **Install-NetworkControllerCluster** cmdlet to create a new network controller cluster.
  - Run the **Install-NetworkController** cmdlet to create the network controller application on top of the cluster.
