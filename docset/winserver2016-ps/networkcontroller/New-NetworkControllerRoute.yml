description: |-
  This cmdlet adds a new route to the Network Controller.
  This route is added to a route table.
  If you want to route traffic to virtual appliances in your environment, you can specify routes and associate them to a virtual subnet.
  Subnets rely on system routes until a route table is associated to the subnet.
  After an association exists, routing is done based on Longest Prefix Match (LPM) among both user defined routes and system routes. 
  If there is more than one route with the same LPM match, then the user defined route is selected first - before the system route.
