description: |-
  The **Set-NetworkController** cmdlet sets network controller application settings.
  You can modify the following settings: 

  - Client authentication mode. 
  - Client security group.
  If the client authentication mode is Kerberos, you must specify a client security group.
  - Client certificate thumbprints.
  If the client authentication mode is x509, you must specify certificate thumbprints.
  - The IP address that network controller uses for representational state transfer (REST) communication.
  - Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate that network controller uses for encrypting the communication between the REST clients and the network controller, as well as to secure communication with southbound clients.
