  The **Export-NpsConfiguration** cmdlet exports settings for Network Policy Server (NPS).
  NPS manages network access policies, connection request authentication, and connection request authorization.
  You can use NPS as a Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) proxy to forward connection requests to NPS or other RADIUS servers that you configure in remote RADIUS server groups.
  For more information about NPS, see [Network Policy Server](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc732912.aspx) on TechNet.

  The exported file contains unencrypted shared secrets for RADIUS clients and members of remote RADIUS server groups.
  Because of this, make sure that you save the file to a secure location.

  The export process does not include logging settings for Microsoft SQL Server in the exported file.
  After you import the exported file to another NPS server, you must manually configure SQL Server Logging on the new server.
