description: "The **Add-DAClient** cmdlet adds one or more client computer security groups (SGs) to the DirectAccess (DA) deployment, adds one or more DA client Group Policy Objects (GPOs) in one or more domains, adds one or more SGs of down-level clients to the DA deployment in a multi-site deployment, or adds one or more down-level DA client GPOs in one or more domains in a multi-site deployment.\r\n\r\nThe client SG and GPO parameters are treated as independent entities.\r\nThe basic paradigm is that client GPOs can be created independent of the SGs and the represented domains.\r\nEvery SG that is added to the DA deployment is added in all current client GPOs.\r\nTherefore all GPOs always contain all SGs even if all the corresponding domains are not represented in all the SGs.\r\n\r\nThere will never be a scenario where an SG is present only in some of the GPOs.\r\nIf this happens, then it means that the state of the configuration is bad.\r\n\r\nExtending this paradigm, adding clients to an SG is a pure SG level operation which can be accomplished using AD cmdlets, such as the Add-ADGroupMember cmdlet.\r\n\r\nAlthough AD cmdlets are already available for the addition of SGs and GPOs, the additional capabilities of this cmdlet are justified as follows. \r\n                       \r\n -- When an SG is added it is added in all Client GPOs.\r\nIf user does not have permissions to edit a GPO, then the SG is not added to any of the Client GPOs in any of the domains.\r\nWhen using the AD cmdlet, the user would have to carefully ensure that it is run for each of the domains and it is difficult to handle the case where the user does not have permissions on some domains. \r\n                       \r\n -- When a GPO is added all SGs are added in the GPO and DA client specific policies are created.\r\nThis cmdlet takes care of the conditions where the GPO is created if not already present.\r\nIf the GPO is already present, then it is merely edited\r\n\r\nThe following are additional behavior notes for the cmdlet. \r\n                       \r\n -- At least one client GPO is always present.\r\nThe Install-RemoteAccess cmdlet always creates a GPO even if there are no SGs added.\r\nThere is never a case where there are no client GPOs.\r\nHowever, if this situation occurs, then adding an SG without specifying a domain or GPO is not allowed.\r\nA GPO can still be added alone, but only when there is no client GPO already present in that domain. \r\n                       \r\n -- If DA is configured to be deployed only on laptops and notebooks, then when a domain or GPO is added, a WMI filter to enforce this policy is created in that domain and applied to all the SGs.\r\nIf the user does not have the permissions to create a filter in a domain, then a GPO is not created in that domain and a non-terminating error is issued. \r\n                       \r\n -- When adding a new GPO, if it is already present in the domain, then it is merely configured with the list of SG and DA client specific policies.\r\nEssentially, it is brought into the DA deployment.\r\nIf it is not present, then it is created first. \r\n                       \r\n -- Attempting to re-add a domain or specify the same GPO name for the domain again will result in no changes being made. \r\n                       \r\n -- Attempting to add a new GPO in a domain that already consists of a client GPO will result in no action being taken and the display of a non-terminating error. \r\n                       \r\n -- Attempting to add SGs in even a single GPO without the correct permissions will result in the cmdlet terminating the processing of the entire list of SGs that were specified.\r\nHowever, the cmdlet still processes the list of GPOs that have been specified. \r\n                       \r\n -- Attempting to create or configure one of the specified GPOs without the correct permissions will result in the cmdlet proceeding with the processing of the remaining GPOs. \r\n                       \r\n -- In a multi-site deployment. \r\n                       \r\n ---- Clients that are added can connect to all the sites. \r\n                       \r\n ---- A separate set of parameters is available for adding down-level clients.\r\nAdditional information can be found under parameter description. \r\n                       \r\n -- If multi-site has not been deployed, attempting to add down-level GPOs or SGs using the **DownlevelGpoName** and **DownlevelSecurityGroupNameList** parameters will display an error."
