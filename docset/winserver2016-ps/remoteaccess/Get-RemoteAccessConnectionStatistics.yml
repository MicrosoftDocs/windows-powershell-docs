  description: |-
    This example disconnects the connection by specifying the IP address of the host from which it originates.
    The output of the disconnect cmdlet displays the IP address of the disconnected host.
    For this example there is one active VPN connection.
    The output of this cmdlet is piped to the [Format-List](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=113302) cmdlet to display the details of the active connection in a list format.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete.

  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

    If a date is not specified, then the time stamp of the last record in the accounting database is used by default.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "2"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />

description: "The **Get-RemoteAccessConnectionStatistics** cmdlet displays the statistics of the real-time, currently active DirectAccess (DA) and VPN connections and the statistics of DA and VPN historical connections for a specified time duration.\r\n\r\nThe statistics for active and historical connections starting or ending on a Remote Access (RA) server are stored in the inbox accounting store on that server.\r\nThis cmdlet retrieves statistics for a specific server.\r\nThis cmdlet is not impacted by multi-site deployment. \r\n                       \r\n -- If neither a start date nor an end date is specified, then statistics for active connections is retrieved. \r\n                       \r\n -- In order to retrieve statistics of historical data, a time duration needs to be specified such as a start date, an end date, or both.\r\nIf only one of them is specified then the time stamp on the first or last record in the accounting database is used to fill the missing information and to create a duration time.\r\n\r\nThe statistics of active connections can be explicitly filtered by the resource accessed over the connections or by the security group that users who originated the connections belong to.\r\nThese filters are not available for statistics of historical connections."
