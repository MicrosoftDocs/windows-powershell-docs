  The **Remove-BgpRouter** cmdlet removes BGP router routers.
  In a multitenant deployment, the cmdlet removes a BGP router for the routing domain or a tenant.
  In a non-multitenant deployment, the cmdlet removes the BGP router for the local computer.
  When you remove a BGP router, the BGP router can no longer read and distribute routing information between autonomous systems (AS).
  In addition, the other routers that added the router as a peer delete all the information learned from the router and recalculate their routes accordingly.
