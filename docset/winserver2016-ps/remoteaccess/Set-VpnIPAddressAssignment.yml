    This cmdlet sets the IPv4 address assignment type to be DHCP which causes IPv4 address assignment to happen from a DHCP server.

  code: "PS C:\\>Set-VpnIPAddressAssignment -IPAssignmentMethod \"StaticPool\" -IPAddressRange \"30.1.1.10\", \"30.1.1.30\" -IPv6Prefix \"2002:836b:2:1000::/64\" -PassThru\r\nWARNING: The remoteaccess service must be restarted for the changes to take effect. \r\n \r\nIPAssignmentMethod : StaticPool \r\nIPAddressRangeList : {30.1.1.10 - 30.1.1.30} \r\nIPv6Prefix         : 2002:836b:2:1000::/64"
  description: |-
    The cmdlet specifies the IPv4 address assignment to happen from the IP range 30.1.1.10 through 30.1.1.30.
    IPv6 prefix 2002:836b:2:1000::/64 is used for IPv6 address assignment.
    Changing the IPv6 prefix requires the remote access service to be restarted in order to take effect.
    This is conveyed through the warning message.

  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ComputerName
  description: |+
    Specifies the IPv4 or IPv6 address, or host name, of the computer on which the VPN server computer specific tasks should be run.
    If this parameter is specified, then the address assignment properties are configured for that VPN server.

  name: EntrypointName
  isRequired: true
  description: "Specifies a site in a multi-site deployment for which the IPv6 prefix needs to be configured.\r\nThis parameter is not applicable to the IPv4 address assignment properties as these properties are always configured at the individual server level and not site level. \r\n                         \r\nIf this parameter is not specified in a multi-site deployment, then this parameter value to which the cmdlet is run is used.\r\nThe server could also be represented by using the **ComputerName** parameter. \r\n                         \r\nIf this parameter and the **ComputerName** parameter are specified and the **ComputerName** does not belong to the site represented by this parameter, then this parameter takes precedence and the authentication type is configured for it.\r\n\r\n"

  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

description: "The **Set-VpnIPAddressAssignment** cmdlet is only used to toggle from one IPv4 address assignment type to another.\r\nThis cmdlet cannot be used to add additional IPv4 address ranges if a static pool IP address assignment is being used. \r\n                       \r\n -- This cmdlet cannot be used to Enable or Disable an IPv4 or IPv6 address assignment."
