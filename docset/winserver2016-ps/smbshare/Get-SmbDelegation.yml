### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Gets the constrained delegation authorizations for an SMB client.
module: SmbShare
notes: |-
  * This cmdlet relies on Active Directory  Windows PowerShell cmdlets to perform its actions. Before you use this cmdlet, you must install the Active Directory cmdlets. To install the Active Directory cmdlets, run the following command: 
  `Install-WindowsFeature RSAT-AD-PowerShell`
  For more information, type `Get-Help Install-WindowsFeature`.

    This cmdlet works only with resource-based delegation, and the Active Directory forest must be at the Windows Server 2012 functional level.
  To check the functional level of the Active Directory forest, use the **Get-ADForest** cmdlet.
