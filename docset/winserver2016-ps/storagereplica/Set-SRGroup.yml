examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Add a volume to a replication group'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Set-SRGroup -Name "ReplicationGroup01" -AddVolumeName "F:"
  description: |-
    This command adds the F: volume to the existing replication group named ReplicationGroup01 on the local computer.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 2: Remove a volume from a replication group'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Set-SRGroup -Name "ReplicationGroup01" -RemoveVolumeName "F:"
  description: |-
    This command removes the F: volume from the existing replication group ReplicationGroup01 on the local computer.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 3: Resize volumes in a replication group'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Set-SRGroup -Name "ReplicationGroup01" -AllowVolumeResize $True
  description: |-
    This command lets you resize volumes in the replication group named ReplicationGroup01 on the local computer.
    By default, the Storage Replica driver prevents volume resizes in order to protect from block mismatches.
    To grow a volume, enable this mode on both resource groups, increase the size of the volume on both servers to be the same size, and then disable this mode.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: AddVolumeName
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of drive letters or mount point paths of partitions for the replica to add to the group.
    The volumes must exist.
    The volumes cannot be mapped drives or UNC paths.

    This is an ordered list.
    The order of volumes determines the order of replication.
    For more information, see the *DestinationVolumeName* parameter of the New-SRPartnership cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "2"
  aliases: AV
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AllowVolumeResize
  description: |+
    Indicates that the replication group enables resizing of volumes.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "10"
  aliases: VR
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimSession" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ComputerName
  description: |+
    Specifies a single replica host computer NetBIOS name or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of a computer.
    The default value is the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: CN
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Description
  description: |+
    Specifies a description for the replication group.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "6"
  aliases: D
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Encryption
  description: |+
    Indicates this partnership should encrypt connections by using SMB AES-128-GCM.
    Enabling encryption can protect Storage Replica block transfers from man-in-the-middle interception or reading.
    Enabling encryption decreases performance.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "9"
  aliases: ENC
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force
  description: |+
    Forces the command to run without asking for user confirmation.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "100"
  aliases: F
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt64" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: LogSizeInBytes
  description: |+
    Specifies the aggregate size of log files on each server in the replication group for the volumes that are associated with this replication group.
    The minimum size 512MB.
    You can specify a value by using the Windows PowerShell byte conversion capability, such as 4GB or 3200MB.

    A value that is too small may cause decreased replication performance or increased recovery time after an interruption between computers.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "4"
  aliases: LS
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the replication group to modify.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: N
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: RemoveVolumeName
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of drive letters or mount point paths of partitions for the replica to remove from the group.
    The volumes must exist.
    The volumes cannot be mapped drives or UNC paths.

    This is an ordered list.
    The order of volumes determines the order of replication.
    For more information, see the *DestinationVolumeName* parameter of the New-SRPartnership cmdlet.

    If there is a partnership already configured, before you change this replication group, you must remove the partnership by using the Set-SRPartnership cmdlet.
    Then you must remove the same volumes from the previously partnered replication group.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "3"
  aliases: RVN
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ReplicationMode" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ReplicationMode
  description: |+
    Specifies the desired mode of replication for this source and destination pair.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Synchronous or 1.
    The synchronous mode requires all writes to commit on the destination server and commit on the source server, which guarantees data integrity between computers. 
    - Asynchronous or 2.
    The asynchronous mode writes to the source server without waiting for the source server, which allows for replication over high latency, geographic networks. 

    The default value is synchronous.
    The default asynchronous recovery point alert time is 5 minutes.
    You can modify it by using the Set-SRPartnership cmdlet.
    The alert time has no effect on replication behavior, only on reporting.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "8"
  aliases: RM
  parameterValueGroup: Synchronous, Asynchronous
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: wi
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: StorageReplica.Set-SRGroup
name: Set-SRGroup
description: |-
  The **Set-SRGroup** cmdlet modifies settings of an existing replication group.
  A replication group contains one or more data volumes and an associated log volume.
  A replication group is the container for replication.
