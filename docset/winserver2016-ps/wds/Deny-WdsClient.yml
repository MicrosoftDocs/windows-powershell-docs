parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job.
    Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 
     The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt.
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes.
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets.
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 
     For more information about Windows PowerShell® background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RequestID
  description: |+
    Specifies the request ID that the server that runs Windows Deployment Services allocates to a device in the Pending Device database.
    To find the Request ID, use the Get-WdsClient cmdlet and look for the **RequestId** property of the client.
    If you do not specify this parameter, the cmdlet denies all devices.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

uid: WDS.Deny-WdsClient
name: Deny-WdsClient
description: |-
  The **Deny-WdsClient** cmdlet denies approval for clients.
  Unknown clients require approval before the server that runs Windows Deployment Services boots the client in Pre-Boot Execution Environment (PXE).
  Use the Approve-WdsClient cmdlet to approve clients.

  You can specify a single device to deny by using a request ID.
  The server that runs Windows Deployment Services allocates a request ID to a device.
  If you do not specify a client to deny, the cmdlet denies approval for all pending clients.
