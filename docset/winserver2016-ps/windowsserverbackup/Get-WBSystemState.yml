    The system state setting enables you to use the backups to perform system state recoveries.

    The first command stores the result of the [Get-WBPolicy](./Get-WBPolicy.yml) cmdlet to the variable named $Policy.

    The second command displays the result of the **Get-WBSystemState** cmdlet using the variable named $Policy.
