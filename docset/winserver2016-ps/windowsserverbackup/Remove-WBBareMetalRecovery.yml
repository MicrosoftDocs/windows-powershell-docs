  The **Remove-WBBareMetalRecovery** cmdlet removes a request to include items that implement a bare metal recovery from the **WBPolicy** object that contains the current backup policy.
  Depending on the contents of the **WBFileSpec** object, the backup process can still back up some items that perform a bare metal recovery, but the backup process itself may not be able to perform a bare metal recovery.

  Before you can add a backup target to a **WBPolicy** object, you must put the **WBPolicy** object in edit mode.
  To put the **WBPolicy** object in edit mode for a policy that you have set as the scheduled backup policy, use the [Get-WBPolicy](./Get-WBPolicy.yml) cmdlet with the  *Editable* parameter.
  The [New-WBPolicy](./New-WBPolicy.yml) cmdlet creates a **WBPolicy** object that is already in edit mode.

  To use this cmdlet, you must be a member of the Administrators group or Backup Operators group.
