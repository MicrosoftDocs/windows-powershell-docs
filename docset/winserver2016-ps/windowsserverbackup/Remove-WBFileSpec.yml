    The first command gets a list of the backup file specifications from the backup policy in the variable named $Policy.
    The command assigns the backup file specifications to the array in the variable named $Filespeclist.

    The second command removes the backup file specification in the first element of $Filespeclist from the policy stored in the $Policy variable.

  The **Remove-WBFileSpec** cmdlet removes a **WBFileSpec** object that contains a backup file specification from a **WBPolicy** object that contains a backup policy.
  A backup file specification contains a list of items to include in or exclude from backups that use the backup policy.

  Before you can remove a backup file specification from a **WBPolicy** object, you must put the **WBPolicy** object in edit mode.
  To put the **WBPolicy** object in edit mode for a policy that you set as the scheduled backup policy, use the [Get-WBPolicy](./Get-WBPolicy.yml) cmdlet with the *Editable* parameter.
  The [New-WBPolicy](./New-WBPolicy.yml) cmdlet creates a new **WBPolicy** object that is already in edit mode.

  To use this cmdlet, you must be a member of the Administrators group or Backup Operators group.
