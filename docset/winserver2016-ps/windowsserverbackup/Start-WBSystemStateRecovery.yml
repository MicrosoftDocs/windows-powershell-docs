  Starts a system state recovery operation.
module: WindowsServerBackup
notes: ""
inputs:
- name: <xref href="WBBackupSet" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    Specifies the backup set that contains volume backup of all the system critical volumes, or contains backup of the system state for the system state recovery operation.
outputs:
- name: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    If you do not specify the *Async* parameter, the recovery operation outputs status at periodic intervals until the recovery operation completes.
    You can also call Get-WBJob to get the status of the current recovery operation.
    After completion of recovery, run Get-WBJob with the *Previous* parameter and an argument of 1 to get the final recovery status.

- title: 'Example 1: Start a system state recovery operation'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> $Backup = Get-WBBackupSet
    PS C:\> Start-WBSystemStateRecovery -BackupSet $Backup -Force -RestartComputer -Async
  description: |-
    This example starts a system state recovery operation, and then restarts the computer at the end of the recovery operation.

    The first command stores the result of [Get-WBBackupSet](./Get-WBBackupSet.yml) in a variable named $Backup.

    The second command starts the system state recovery from the backup stored in the $Backup variable.
    The command also uses the *Force* parameter to perform the recovery without prompting, the *RestartComputer* parameter to restart the computer when recovery finishes, and the *Async* parameter to suppress status output.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ADIFM
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Indicates that this cmdlet recovers all the related data needed for Active Directory Domain Services from an install from a media (IFM) operation.
    Active Directory Install From Media (ADIFM) creates a copy of the Active Directory database, registry, and SYSVOL state, and then saves this information in the location specified by the *RecoveryTarget* parameter.
    Use this parameter only when *RecoveryTarget* is specified.
    This parameter is valid only if the backup set contains an Active Directory system state backup.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "1"

  name: TargetPath
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an alternate location where the files belonging to system state can be recovered from the backup set.
    If you do not specify this parameter, system state recovery is performed for the actual computer, which needs a restart at the end of the operation.
    ADIFM recovery requires this parameter.

  defaultValue: None

description: |-
  The **Start-WBSystemStateRecovery** cmdlet starts a system state recovery operation.
