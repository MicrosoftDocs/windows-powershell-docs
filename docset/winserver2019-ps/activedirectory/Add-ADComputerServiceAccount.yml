parameters:
- type: <xref href="ADAuthType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AuthType
  description: |+
    Specifies the authentication method to use.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Negotiate or 0
    - Basic or 1

    The default authentication method is Negotiate.

    A Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection is required for the Basic authentication method.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Negotiate, Basic
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Credential
  description: |+
    Specifies the user account credentials to use to perform this task.
    The default credentials are the credentials of the currently logged on user unless the cmdlet is run from an Active Directory module for Windows PowerShell provider drive.
    If the cmdlet is run from such a provider drive, the account associated with the drive is the default.

    To specify this parameter, you can type a user name, such as User1 or Domain01\User01 or you can specify a **PSCredential** object.
    If you specify a user name for this parameter, the cmdlet prompts for a password.

    You can also create a **PSCredential** object by using a script or by using the **Get-Credential** cmdlet.
    You can then set the *Credential* parameter to the **PSCredential** object.

    If the acting credentials do not have directory-level permission to perform the task, Active Directory module for Windows PowerShell returns a terminating error.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ADComputer" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an Active Directory computer object by providing one of the following property values.
    The identifier in parentheses is the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) display name for the attribute.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - A distinguished name
    - A GUID (objectGUID) 
    - A security identifier (objectSid) 
    - Security Accounts Manager account name (sAMAccountName)

    The cmdlet searches the default naming context or partition to find the object.
    If the identifier given is a distinguished name, the partition to search is computed from that distinguished name.
    If two or more objects are found, the cmdlet returns a non-terminating error.

    This parameter can also get this object through the pipeline or you can set this parameter to a computer object instance.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: Computer
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Partition
  description: |+
    Specifies the distinguished name of an Active Directory partition.
    The distinguished name must be one of the naming contexts on the current directory server.
    The cmdlet searches this partition to find the object defined by the *Identity* parameter.

    In many cases, a default value is used for the *Partition* parameter if no value is specified.
    The rules for determining the default value are given below.
    Note that rules listed first are evaluated first and once a default value can be determined, no further rules are evaluated.

    In Active Directory Domain Services environments, a default value for *Partition* is set in the following cases: 

    - If the *Identity* parameter is set to a distinguished name, the default value of *Partition* is automatically generated from this distinguished name. 
    - If running cmdlets from an Active Directory provider drive, the default value of *Partition* is automatically generated from the current path in the drive. 
    - If none of the previous cases apply, the default value of *Partition* is set to the default partition or naming context of the target domain.

    In Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) environments, a default value for *Partition* is set in the following cases:

    - If the *Identity* parameter is set to a distinguished name, the default value of *Partition* is automatically generated from this distinguished name.
    - If running cmdlets from an Active Directory provider drive, the default value of *Partition* is automatically generated from the current path in the drive. 
    - If the target AD LDS instance has a default naming context, the default value of *Partition* is set to the default naming context.
    To specify a default naming context for an AD LDS environment, set the **msDS-defaultNamingContext** property of the Active Directory directory service agent (DSA) object (**nTDSDSA**) for the AD LDS instance. 
    - If none of the previous cases apply, the *Partition* parameter will not take any default value.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PassThru
  description: |+
    Returns an object representing the item with which you are working.
    By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Server
  description: |+
    Specifies the Active Directory Domain Services instance to connect to, by providing one of the following values for a corresponding domain name or directory server.
    The service may be any of the following: Active Directory Lightweight Domain Services, Active Directory Domain Services or Active Directory snapshot instance.

    Specify the Active Directory Domain Services instance in one of the following ways: 

    Domain name values:

    - Fully qualified domain name
    - NetBIOS name

    Directory server values: 

    - Fully qualified directory server name
    - NetBIOS name
    - Fully qualified directory server name and port

    The default value for this parameter is determined by one of the following methods in the order that they are listed:

    - By using the **Server** value from objects passed through the pipeline
    - By using the server information associated with the Active Directory Domain Services Windows PowerShell provider drive, when the cmdlet runs in that drive
    - By using the domain of the computer running Windows PowerShell

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ADServiceAccount" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: ServiceAccount
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies one or more Active Directory service accounts.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - A distinguished name
    - A GUID (objectGUID) 
    - A Security Identifier (objectSid) 
    - SAM account name (sAMAccountName)

  defaultValue: None
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: wi
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: ActiveDirectory.Add-ADComputerServiceAccount
name: Add-ADComputerServiceAccount
description: |-
  The **Add-ADComputerServiceAccount** cmdlet adds one or more computer service accounts to an Active Directory computer.

  The *Computer* parameter specifies the Active Directory computer that will host the new service accounts.
  You can identify a computer by its distinguished name, GUID, security identifier (SID) or Security Accounts Manager (SAM) account name.
  You can also set the *Computer* parameter to a computer object variable, such as `$<localComputerobject>`, or pass a computer object through the pipeline to the *Computer* parameter.
  For example, you can use the **Get-ADComputer** cmdlet to retrieve a computer object and then pass the object through the pipeline to the **Add-ADComputerServiceAccount** cmdlet.

  The *ServiceAccount* parameter specifies the service accounts to add.
  You can identify a service account by its distinguished name, GUID, Security Identifier (SID) or Security Accounts Manager (SAM) account name.
  You can also specify service account object variables, such as `$<localServiceAccountObject>`.
  If you are specifying more than one account, use a comma-separated list.

  Note: Adding a service account is a different operation than installing the service account locally.
