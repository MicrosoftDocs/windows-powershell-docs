parameters:
- type: <xref href="ADAuthType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AuthType
  description: |+
    Specifies the authentication method to use.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Negotiate or 0
    - Basic or 1

    The default authentication method is Negotiate.

    A Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection is required for the Basic authentication method.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Negotiate, Basic
- type: <xref href="PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Credential
  description: |+
    Specifies a user account that has permission to perform this action.
    The default is the current user.

    Type a user name, such as User01 or Domain01\User01, or enter a **PSCredential** object, such as one generated by the **Get-Credential** cmdlet.
    If you type a user name, you will be prompted for a password.

    This parameter is not supported by any providers installed with Windows PowerShell.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: EnumeratingServer
  description: |+
    Specifies the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) instance to connect to, by providing one of the following values for a corresponding domain name or directory server.
    The service may be any of the following: Active Directory Lightweight Domain Services (AD LDS), AD DS, or Active Directory snapshot instance.

    Specify the instance in one of the following ways:  

    Domain name values:

    - Fully qualified domain name
    - NetBIOS name

    Directory server values: 

    - Fully qualified directory server name
    - NetBIOS name
    - Fully qualified directory server name and port

    The default value for this parameter is determined by one of the following methods in the order that they are listed:

    - By using the *Server* value from objects passed through the pipeline
    - By using the server information associated with the AD DS Windows PowerShell provider drive, when the cmdlet runs in that drive
    - By using the domain of the computer running Windows PowerShell

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Filter
  description: |+
    Specifies a filter in the provider's format or language.
    The value of this parameter qualifies the *Path* parameter.
    The syntax of the filter, including the use of wildcards, depends on the provider.
    Filters are more efficient than other parameters, because the provider applies them when retrieving the objects, rather than having Windows PowerShell filter the objects after they are retrieved.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ADScopeType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Scope
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the type of object used as input by the *Target* parameter.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Server
    - Site
    - Domain
    - Forest

  defaultValue: None
  position: "1"
  aliases: ReplicationSite
  parameterValueGroup: Server, Domain, Forest, Site
- type: <xref href="Object" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Target
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies either one or more (using a comma separated list) of Active Directory domain controllers, sites, domains, or forests.
    It returns results for all the domain controllers that are specified or that are part of the specified container.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: Name, HostName, Site, Domain, Forest
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: ActiveDirectory.Get-ADReplicationFailure
name: Get-ADReplicationFailure
description: |-
  The **Get-ADReplicationFailure** cmdlet returns all failures currently associated with a given domain controller or Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) instance.
  The return object is of type **ADReplicationFailure**.
  This cmdlet returns the list of failures in the **ADReplicationSummary** object for a specific server.
