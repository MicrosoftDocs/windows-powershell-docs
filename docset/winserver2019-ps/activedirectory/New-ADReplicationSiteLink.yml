parameters:
- type: <xref href="ADAuthType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AuthType
  description: |+
    Specifies the authentication method to use.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Negotiate or 0
    - Basic or 1

    The default authentication method is Negotiate.

    A Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection is required for the Basic authentication method.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Negotiate, Basic
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Cost
  description: |+
    Specifies the cost to be placed on the site link.
    For more information on determining the cost, see [Determining the Cost](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=221871) in the TechNet Library: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=221871.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Credential
  description: |+
    Specifies the user account credentials to use to perform this task.
    The default credentials are the credentials of the currently logged on user unless the cmdlet is run from an Active Directory module for Windows PowerShell provider drive.
    If the cmdlet is run from such a provider drive, the account associated with the drive is the default.

    To specify this parameter, you can type a user name, such as User1 or Domain01\User01 or you can specify a **PSCredential** object.
    If you specify a user name for this parameter, the cmdlet prompts for a password.

    You can also create a **PSCredential** object by using a script or by using the **Get-Credential** cmdlet.
    You can then set the *Credential* parameter to the **PSCredential** object.

    If the acting credentials do not have directory-level permission to perform the task, Active Directory module for Windows PowerShell returns a terminating error.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Description
  description: |+
    Specifies a description of the object.
    This parameter sets the value of the **Description** property for the object.
    The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) display name (**ldapDisplayName**) for this property is description.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ADReplicationSiteLink" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Instance
  description: |+
    Specifies an instance of a site link object to use as a template for a new site link object.

    You can use an instance of an existing site link object as a template or you can construct a new site link object by using the Windows PowerShell command line or by using a script.

    Method 1: Use an existing site link object as a template for a new object.
    To retrieve an instance of an existing site link object, use a cmdlet such as **Get-ADReplicationSiteLink**.
    Then provide this object to the *Instance* parameter of the **New-ADReplicationSiteLink** cmdlet to create a new Active Directory object.
    You can override property values of the new object by setting the appropriate parameters.

    Method 2: Create a new **ADReplicationSiteLink** and set the property values by using the Windows PowerShell command line interface.
    Then pass this object to the Instance parameter of the **New-ADReplicationSiteLink** cmdlet to create the new site link object.

    Note: Specified attributes are not validated, so attempting to set attributes that do not exist or cannot be set raises an error.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ADInterSiteTransportProtocolType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: InterSiteTransportProtocol
  description: |+
    Specifies a valid intersite transport protocol option.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - IP
    - SMTP

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: IP, SMTP
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the site link.
    This parameter sets the **Name** property of the Active Directory object.
    The LDAP display name (**ldapDisplayName**) of this property is name.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Hashtable" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: OtherAttributes
  description: |+
    Specifies object attribute values for attributes that are not represented by cmdlet parameters.
    You can set one or more parameters at the same time with this parameter.
    If an attribute takes more than one value, you can assign multiple values.
    To identify an attribute, specify the LDAPDisplayName (**ldapDisplayName**) defined for it in the Active Directory schema.

    Syntax:

    To specify a single value for an attribute:

    `-OtherAttributes @{'AttributeLDAPDisplayName'=value}`

    To specify multiple values for an attribute

    `-OtherAttributes @{'AttributeLDAPDisplayName'=value1,value2,...}`

    You can specify values for more than one attribute by using semicolons to separate attributes.
    The following syntax shows how to set values for multiple attributes:

    `-OtherAttributes @{'Attribute1LDAPDisplayName'=value; 'Attribute2LDAPDisplayName'=value1,value2;...}`

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PassThru
  description: |+

    By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ReplicationFrequencyInMinutes
  description: |+
    Species the frequency, in minutes, for which replication will occur where this site link is in use between sites.
    Active Directory preserves bandwidth between sites by minimizing the frequency of replication and by allowing you to schedule the availability of site links for replication.
    By default, intersite replication across each site link occurs every 180 minutes (3 hours).
    You can adjust this frequency to match your specific needs.
    Be aware that increasing this frequency increases the amount of bandwidth used by replication.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ActiveDirectorySchedule" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ReplicationSchedule
  description: |+
    Specifies the default replication schedule for any connections within this site link (intra-site replication).
    This allows you to schedule the availability of site links for use by replication.
    By default, a site link is available to carry replication traffic 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
    You can limit this schedule to specific days of the week and times of day.
    You can, for example, schedule intersite replication so that it only occurs after normal business hours.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Server
  description: |+
    Specifies the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) instance to connect to, by providing one of the following values for a corresponding domain name or directory server.
    The service may be any of the following: Active Directory Lightweight Domain Services (AD LDS), AD DS, or Active Directory snapshot instance.

    Specify the AD DS instance in one of the following ways:  

    Domain name values:

    - Fully qualified domain name
    - NetBIOS name

    Directory server values:  

    - Fully qualified directory server name
    - NetBIOS name
    - Fully qualified directory server name and port

    The default value for this parameter is determined by one of the following methods in the order that they are listed:

    - By using the *Server* value from objects passed through the pipeline
    - By using the server information associated with the AD DS Windows PowerShell provider drive, when the cmdlet runs in that drive
    - By using the domain of the computer running Windows PowerShell

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ADReplicationSite" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: SitesIncluded

uid: ActiveDirectory.New-ADReplicationSiteLink
name: New-ADReplicationSiteLink
description: |-
  The **New-ADReplicationSiteLink** cmdlet can be used to create a new Active Directory site link.
  A site link connects two or more sites.
  Site links reflect the administrative policy for how sites are to be interconnected and the methods used to transfer replication traffic.
  You must connect sites with site links so that domain controllers at each site can replicate Active Directory changes.
