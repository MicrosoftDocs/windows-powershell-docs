  name: Credential
  description: |+
    Specifies the user account credentials to use to perform this task.
    The default credentials are the credentials of the currently logged on user unless the cmdlet is run from an Active Directory module for Windows PowerShell provider drive.
    If the cmdlet is run from such a provider drive, the account associated with the drive is the default.

    To specify this parameter, you can type a user name, such as User1 or Domain01\User01 or you can specify a **PSCredential** object.
    If you specify a user name for this parameter, the cmdlet prompts for a password.

    You can also create a **PSCredential** object by using a script or by using the **Get-Credential** cmdlet.
    You can then set the *Credential* parameter to the **PSCredential** object.

    The identifier in parentheses is the LDAP display name for the attribute. 
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - A distinguished name
    - A GUID (objectGUID)

    The cmdlet searches the default naming context or partition to find the object.
    If two or more objects are found, the cmdlet returns a non-terminating error.

    This parameter can also get this object through the pipeline or you can set this parameter to an object instance.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""

- type: <xref href="ADReplicationSiteLink" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Instance
  description: |+
    Specifies an instance of a site link object to use as a template for a new site link object.

    You can use an instance of an existing site link object as a template or you can construct a new site link object by using the Windows PowerShell command line or by using a script.

    Method 1: Use an existing site link object as a template for a new object.
    To retrieve an instance of an existing site link object, use a cmdlet such as **Get-ADReplicationSiteLink**.
    Then provide this object to the *Instance* parameter of the **New-ADReplicationSiteLink** cmdlet to create a new site link object.
    You can override property values of the new object by setting the appropriate parameters.

    Method 2: Create a new **ADReplicationSiteLink** and set the property values by using the Windows PowerShell command line interface.
    Then pass this object to the *Instance* parameter of the **New-ADReplicationSiteLink** cmdlet to create the new Active Directory object.

    Note: Specified attributes are not validated, so attempting to set attributes that do not exist or cannot be set will raise an error.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PassThru

    Use this parameter to remove one or more values of a property that cannot be modified using a cmdlet parameter.
    To remove an object property, you must use the LDAP display name.
    You can remove more than one property by specifying a semicolon-separated list.
    The format for this parameter is:

    `-Remove @{Attribute1LDAPDisplayName=value[];   Attribute2LDAPDisplayName=value[]}`

    When you use the *Add*, *Remove*, *Replace*, and *Clear* parameters together, the parameters will be applied in the following sequence:

    - **Remove**
    - **Add**
    - **Replace**
    - **Clear**

  defaultValue: None

  name: ReplicationFrequencyInMinutes
  description: |+
    Species the frequency, in minutes, for which replication will occur where this site link is in use between sites.
    Active Directory preserves bandwidth between sites by minimizing the frequency of replication and by allowing you to schedule the availability of site links for replication.
    By default, intersite replication across each site link occurs every 180 minutes (3 hours).
    You can adjust this frequency to match your specific needs.
    Be aware that increasing this frequency increases the amount of bandwidth used by replication.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ActiveDirectorySchedule" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ReplicationSchedule
  description: |+
    Specifies the default replication schedule for any connections within this site link (intra-site replication).
    This allows you to schedule the availability of site links for use by replication.
    By default, a site link is available to carry replication traffic 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
    You can limit this schedule to specific days of the week and times of day.
    You can, for example, schedule intersite replication so that it only occurs after normal business hours.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Server
  description: |+
    Specifies the Active Directory Domain Services instance to connect to, by providing one of the following values for a corresponding domain name or directory server.
    The service may be any of the following: Active Directory Lightweight Domain Services, Active Directory Domain Services or Active Directory Snapshot instance.

    Domain name values:

    - Fully qualified domain name (FQDN)
    - NetBIOS name

    Directory server values:

    - Fully qualified directory server name
    - NetBIOS name
    - Fully qualified directory server name and port

    The default value for the *Server* parameter is determined by one of the following methods in the order that they are listed:

    - By using *Server* value from objects passed through the pipeline. 
    - By using the server information associated with the Active Directory PowerShell provider drive, when running under that drive. 
    - By using the domain of the computer running PowerShell.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Hashtable" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SitesIncluded
  description: |+
    Specifies the list of sites included in the site link.
