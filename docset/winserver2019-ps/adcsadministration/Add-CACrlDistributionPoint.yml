description: |-
  The **Add-CACRLDistributionPoint** cmdlet adds a certificate revocation list (CRL) distribution point uniform resource indicator (URI) where Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) publishes certification revocations.

  You can add CRL distribution points in issued certificates by using this Windows PowerShell cmdlet.
  However, adding the URL for a CRL distribution point only affects newly issued certificates.
  Previously issued certificates will continue to reference the original location.

  To indicate that you want to use a URL as a CRL distribution point, use the switch parameter *PublishCRL*.

  To indicate that you want to use a URL as a delta CRL distribution point, use the switch parameter *PublishDeltaCRL*.

  To indicate that you want to publish this location in CRLs to point clients to a delta CRL, use the switch parameter *IncludeDeltaCRLs*.

  CRL uniform resource locators can be HTTP or Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) paths.
  You can use the following variables depending upon the switch when specifying the address of the CRL.

  `<CAName>`, which is replaced by the name of the targeted CA.

  `<CAObjectClass>`, which is replaced by object class identifier for a CA, used when publishing to an LDAP URL.

  `<CATruncatedName>`, which is replaced by sanitized name of the CA, truncated to 32 characters with a hash at the end.

  `<CDPObjectClass>`, which is replaced by the object class identifier for CRL distribution points, used when publishing to an LDAP URL.

  `<CertificateName>`, which is replaced by the renewal extension of the CA.

  `<ConfigurationContainer>`, which is replaced by the location of the Configuration container in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) location.

  `<CRLNameSuffix>`, which is replaced by inserts a name suffix at the end of the file name when publishing a CRL to a file or URL.

  `<DeltaCRLAllowed>`, which is replaced by the CRLNameSuffix variable with a separate suffix to distinguish the delta CRL from the CRL; used when a delta CRL is published.

  `<ServerDNSName>`, which is replaced by the DNS name of the CA server.

  `<ServerShortName>`, which is replaced by the NetBIOS name of the CA server.
