  description: |-
    This command runs the prerequisites to determine if installing a new child domain named child.corp.contoso.com using credentials of CORP\EnterpriseAdmin1 is possible.
    This command also installs a DNS server, creates a DNS delegation in the corp.contoso.com domain, sets the domain functional level to Windows Server 2003, makes the domain controller a global catalog server in a site named Houston, and uses DC1.corp.contoso.com as the replication source domain controller.
    The command also installs the Active Directory database and SYSVOL on the D:\ drive, installs the log files on the E:\ drive, has the server not automatically restart after the domain installation is complete and prompts the user to provide and confirm the Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) password to complete and commit the installation of the domain in Active Directory.

- type: <xref href="PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DnsDelegationCredential
  description: |+
    Specifies the user name and password for the user that creates the DNS delegation.
    This parameter is skipped if the value for the *CreateDnsDelegation* parameter is either specified or computed to be $False.

  defaultValue: "NULL"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="DomainMode" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainMode
  description: |+
    Specifies the domain functional level of the first domain in the creation of a new forest.
    Supported values for this parameter can be either a valid integer or a corresponding enumerated string value.
    For instance, to set the domain mode level to Windows Server 2008 R2, you can specify either a value of 4 or Win2008R2.

    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Windows Server 2003:  2 or Win2003
    - Windows Server 2008:  3 or Win2008
    - Windows Server 2008 R2:  4 or Win2008R2
    - Windows Server 2012:  5 or Win2012
    - Windows Server 2012 R2:  6 or Win2012R2

    The domain functional level cannot be lower than the forest functional level, but it can be higher.
    The default is automatically computed and set.

  defaultValue: Windows2008R2
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Win2008, Win2008R2, Win2012, Win2012R2, WinThreshold, Default
- type: <xref href="DomainType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainType
  description: |+
    Specifies the type of domain that this cmdlet creates: a new domain tree in an existing forest (supported values are TreeDomain or tree), a child of an existing domain (supported values are ChildDomain or child).
    The default is ChildDomain.

  defaultValue: ChildDomain
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ChildDomain, TreeDomain
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force
  description: |+
    Forces the command to run without asking for user confirmation.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: InstallDns
  description: |+
    Indicates that this cmdlet installs and configures the DNS Server service for the domain or domain tree.
    For domain installation, if this parameter is left unspecified and the parent domain (or in the case of a domain tree, the forest root domain) already hosts and stores the DNS names for the domain, then the default for this parameter is $True and the DNS server is installed.
    Otherwise, if DNS domain names are hosted outside of Active Directory, the default is $False and no DNS server is installed.

    To test if DNS domain names are hosted outside of Active Directory, this cmdlet uses a start of authority (SOA) type DNS.
    For instance, if the value of *NewDomainName* is corp.contoso.com, Active Directory performs an SOA query for corp.contoso.com and ensures that the zone name in the response is corp.contoso.com.

  defaultValue: "NULL"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: LogPath
  description: |+
    Specifies the fully qualified, non-UNC path to a directory on a fixed disk of the local computer that will contain the domain log files, for example, C:\Windows\Logs.
    The default is %SYSTEMROOT%\NTDS.

  defaultValue: "NULL"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: NewDomainName
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the new name of the domain.
    If the value set for *DomainType* is set to TreeDomain, this parameter can be used to specify the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the new domain tree (for example, contoso.com).
    If the value set for *DomainType* is set to ChildDomain, this parameter can be used to specify a single label domain name for the child domain (for example, specify corp to make a new domain corp.contoso.com if the new domain is in the contoso.com domain tree).

  defaultValue: <mandatory>
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: NewDomainNetbiosName
  description: |+
    Specifies the NetBIOS name for the new domain.
    For NetBIOS names to be valid for use with this parameter they must be single label names of 15 characters or less.

    If this parameter is set with a valid NetBIOS name value, then promotion continues with the name specified.
    If this parameter is not set, then the default is automatically computed from the value of the *NewDomainName* parameter.

    For instance, if this parameter is not specified and a single-label prefix domain name of 15 characters or less is specified within the value of the *NewDomainName* parameter, then promotion continues with an automatically generated NetBIOS domain name.
    For example, the prefix label corp within a full domain name value of corp.contoso.com would be a successful name choice.
    If the label is more than 16 characters, the operation will fail.

  defaultValue: "NULL"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: NoDnsOnNetwork
  description: |+
    Indicates that the DNS service is not available on the network.
    This parameter is used only when the IP setting of the network adapter for this computer is not configured with the name of a DNS server for name resolution.
    It indicates that a DNS server is installed on this computer for name resolution.
    Otherwise, the IP settings of the network adapter must first be configured with the address of a DNS server.

    Omitting this parameter, the default value, indicates that the TCP/IP client settings of the network adapter on this server computer is used to contact a DNS server.
    Therefore, if you are not specifying this parameter, ensure that TCP/IP client settings are first configured with a preferred DNS server address.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: NoGlobalCatalog
  description: |+
    Indicates that the read-only domain controller (RODC) will not be a global catalog server.
    By default, the domain controller that you are installing is a global catalog server.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: NoRebootOnCompletion
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet restarts the computer upon completion, regardless of success.
    By default, reboot upon completion occurs when this cmdlet is used and this parameter is omitted.
    As a general rule, Microsoft support recommends that you not use this parameter except for testing or troubleshooting purposes because once configuration has completed the server will not function correctly as either a member server or a DC until it is rebooted.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ParentDomainName
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of an existing parent domain.

  defaultValue: <mandatory>
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ReplicationSourceDC
  description: |+
    Specifies the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the domain controller to be used as the source for replicating to this domain.
    The default value for this parameter is automatically computed from the environment.

  defaultValue: "NULL"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SecureString" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SafeModeAdministratorPassword
  description: |+
    Supplies the password for the administrator account when the computer is started in Safe Mode or a variant of Safe Mode, such as Directory Services Restore Mode.
    You must supply a password that meets the password complexity rules of the domain and the password cannot be blank.
    If specified with a value, the value must be a secure string.

    If this parameter is not specified, the cmdlet prompts you to enter and confirm a masked password.
    This is the preferred usage when running the cmdlet interactively.
    If additionally there are no other arguments specified with the cmdlet, you are prompted to enter a masked password for this parameter but no confirmation of the password entered is made.
    This is not recommended as it could allow a mistyped password to be configured.
    Another available advanced option is to use the **ConvertTo-SecureString** cmdlet and specify the password string inline as unmasked console input, which is also not a recommended security best practice in production deployments.

  defaultValue: <mandatory>
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SiteName
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of an existing site where you can place the new domain controller.
    The default value is the site that is associated with the subnet that includes the IP address of this server.
    If no such site exists, the default is the site of the replication source domain controller.

  defaultValue: "NULL"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SkipAutoConfigureDns
  description: |+
    Indicates that this cmdlet skips automatic configuration of DNS client settings, forwarders, and root hints.
    This parameter is in effect only if the DNS Server service is already installed.

  defaultValue: "NULL"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SysvolPath
  description: |+
    Specifies the fully qualified, non-UNC path to a directory on a fixed disk of the local computer, for example, C:\Windows\SYSVOL.
    The default is %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSVOL.

  defaultValue: "NULL"

  The **Test-ADDSDomainInstallation** cmdlet runs those prerequisite checks which would be performed if you were to use the **Install-ADDSDomainController** cmdlet to install a new Active Directory domain configuration.
  It differs from using the *WhatIf* parameter with the **Install-ADDSDomainController** cmdlet in that instead of summarizing the changes that would occur during the installation process, this cmdlet actually tests whether those changes are possible given the current environment.

  For more information on the scope of these prerequisite checks that the ADDSDeployment module performs when using this cmdlet see the section ADPrep and Prerequisite Checking Architecture in [AD DS Simplified Administration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=237244).
