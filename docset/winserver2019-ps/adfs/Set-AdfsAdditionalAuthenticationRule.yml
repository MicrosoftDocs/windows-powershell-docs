description: |-
  The **Set-AdfsAdditionalAuthenticationRule** cmdlet sets the global rules that provide the trigger for additional authentication providers to be invoked.
  When the claims engine evaluates the additional authentication rules and determines the requirement for multiple factor authentication, the user is prompted to perform additional authentication.
  You may specify rules in the form of claim rules strings, or designate a file that contains claim rules.

  Use this rule only when all your applications are capable of performing web based credential collection through Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS).
  Applications that use protocols like WS-Trust will fail to obtain a security token if the trigger is true as a result of evaluation of the rules.

  You can also set rules on the individual relying party trust using the **Set-AdfsRelyingPartyTrust** cmdlet with the **AdditionalAuthenticationRule** parameter.
