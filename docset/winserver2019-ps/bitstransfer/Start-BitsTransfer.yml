### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Creates a BITS transfer job.
module: BitsTransfer
notes: |-
  * You can cancel a transfer job that is running in synchronous mode by pressing CTRL+C.

    If the BITS service is stopped during a synchronous file transfer job, then file transfer job will fail with an error and the file transfer job will not get removed from the BitsTransfer queue.
  You can view the file transfer job that remains in the BitsTransfer queue through the **Get-BitsTransfer** cmdlet.
  The file transfer job that remains in the BitsTransfer queue can be removed using the **Remove-BitsTransfer** cmdlet.
  Once the BITS service is restarted, the file transfer job will recover and resume the file transfer job, unless the file transfer job has been removed in the interim.

  code: |-
    PS C:\> Start-BitsTransfer -Source "http://server01/servertestdir/testfile1.txt" -Destination "c:\clienttestdir\testfile1.txt"
  description: |-
    This command creates a BITS transfer job that downloads a file from a server.
    The local and remote names of the file are specified in the *Source* and *Destination* parameters.
    Because the default transfer type is Download, the `http://Server01/servertestdir/testfile1.txt` file is transferred to `C:\clienttestdir\testfile1.txt` on the client.
    The command prompt returns when the file transfer is complete or when it enters an error state.

    When you upload files to an HTTP location, the *TransferType* parameter must be set to **Upload**.

    Because the **Start-BitsTransfer** cmdlet assumes that the first parameter is the source and that the second parameter is the destination when no value is specified, this command could be simplified as follows:

    `Start-BitsTransfer "http://server01/servertestdir/testfile1.txt" "c:\clienttestdir\testfile1.txt"`

  code: |-
    PS C:\> Import-CSV filelist.txt | Start-BitsTransfer
  description: |-
    This command creates BITS transfer jobs that download multiple files from a server.

    The command imports the source and destination file locations and then pipes the locations to the **Start-BitsTransfer** command.
    The **Start-BitsTransfer** command creates a new BITS transfer job for each of the files in `filelist.txt` and then transfers them concurrently to the client.

    The contents of the filelist.txt file resemble the following information:

    Source, Destination
    http://server01/servertestdir/testfile1.txt, c:\clienttestdir\testfile1.txt
    http://server01/servertestdir/testfile2.txt, c:\clienttestdir\testfile2.txt
    http://server01/servertestdir/testfile3.txt, c:\clienttestdir\testfile3.txt
    http://server01/servertestdir/testfile4.txt, c:\clienttestdir\testfile4.txt

  description: |-
    This command creates a BITS transfer job that uploads a file to a server.
    The local and remote names of the file are specified in the **Source** and **Destination** parameters.
    Because the default transfer type is Download, the *TransferType* parameter must be set to **Upload**.
    The `C:\clienttestdir\testfile1.txt` file on the client is transferred to `http://Server01/servertestdir/testfile1.txt`.
    The command prompt returns when the file transfer is complete or enters an error state.

    The **Start-BitsTransfer** cmdlet downloads multiple files from a server to a client computer, but it does not typically upload multiple files from a client computer to a server.
    It is possible to work around this limitation by using the **Import-Csv** cmdlet to pipe the output to the **Start-BitsTransfer** cmdlet.
    If you need to upload more than one file, you can also use a .cab or .zip file.

    Because the **Start-BitsTransfer** cmdlet assumes that the first parameter is the source and that the second parameter is the destination when no value is specified, this command could be simplified as follows:

    `Start-BitsTransfer "c:\clienttestdir\testfile1.txt" "http://server01/servertestdir/testfile1.txt" -TransferType Upload`

  description: |-
    This command creates a BITS transfer job that downloads multiple files from a server.

    The local and remote names of the files are specified in the *Source* and *Destination* parameters.

  description: |-
    This example creates a BITS transfer job that downloads a file from a server by using a specific set of credentials.

    The first command retrieves a set of credentials from the user by calling the **Get-Credential** cmdlet.
    The returned **PSCredential** object is stored in the $Cred variable.

    The second command uses the *Credential* parameter to pass the **PSCredential** object that is stored in the $Cred variable to the **Start-BitsTransfer** cmdlet.
    A new BITS transfer job is created that downloads the `http://server01/servertestdir/testfile1.txt` file to the client.
    The specified credentials are used to authenticate the user at the server.
    Additionally, the optional *DisplayName* parameter is used to give the BITS transfer job a unique name.

    PS C:\> Start-BitsTransfer -Source .\Patch0416.msu -Destination $env:temp\Patch0416.msu -ProxyUsage Override -ProxyList BitsProxy:8080 -ProxyCredential Server01\Admin01
  description: |-
    This command uses the **Start-BitsTransfer** cmdlet to copy a patch file from a server on one network to a client on a different network when the networks are connected only by a proxy server.

    This scenario arises when an Internet-connected server downloads files and then distributes them to computers on disconnected or isolated networks that have no Internet access.

    BITS can detect proxy server settings automatically.
    However, if the proxy servers are not configured for automatic detection, you can override the automatic detection mechanism and identify the proxy server explicitly, as shown in this example.

    The command uses the *Source* parameter to specify the location of the patch on the server computer and the *Destination* parameter to specify the intended location of patch on the client computer.
    It uses the *ProxyUsage* parameter with a value of **Override** to override the automatic proxy server detection mechanism.
    To identify the proxy server, it uses the *ProxyList* parameter.
    The value of the *ProxyList* parameter is a URI with a `<Name:Port>` format.
    Finally, it uses the *ProxyCredential* parameter to specify the credentials of an administrator who has permission to connect to the proxy server.

  name: Priority
  description: |+
    Sets the priority of the BITS transfer job, which affects bandwidth usage.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - **Foreground** (default): Transfers the job in the foreground. Foreground transfers compete for network bandwidth with other applications, which can impede the user's overall network experience. However, if the **Start-BitsTransfer** cmdlet is being used interactively, this is likely the best option. This is the highest priority level.

    - **High**: Transfers the job in the background with a high priority. Background transfers use the idle network bandwidth of the client computer to transfer files.

    - **Normal**: Transfers the job in the background with a normal priority. Background transfers use the idle network bandwidth of the client computer to transfer files.

    - **Low**: Transfers the job in the background with a low priority. Background transfers use the idle network bandwidth of the client to transfer files. This is the lowest background priority level.

  name: ProxyUsage
  description: |+
    Specifies the proxy usage settings.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - **SystemDefault** (the default): Use the system default proxy settings.

    - **NoProxy**: Do not use a proxy to transfer files. Use this option when you transfer files within a local area network (LAN).

    - **AutoDetect**: Automatically detect proxy settings. BITS detects proxy settings for each file in the job.

    - **Override**: Specify the proxies or servers to use. If the *ProxyList* parameter is also specified, the proxies in that list are used. If the *ProxyBypass* parameter is also specified, the servers in that list are used. In both cases, the first member of the list is used. If the first member is unreachable, the subsequent members are tried until a member is contacted successfully.

  name: RetryInterval
  description: |+
    Specifies the minimum length of time, in seconds, that BITS waits before an attempt to transfer the file after BITS encounters a transient error.
    The minimum allowed value is 60 seconds.
    If this value exceeds the RetryTimeout value from the **BitsJob** object, BITS does not retry the transfer.
    Instead, BITS sets the state of the BITS transfer job to the Error state.

    The default is 600 seconds (10 minutes).

    Specifies the length of time, in seconds, that BITS attempts to transfer the file after the first transient error occurs.
    Setting the retry period to 0 prevents retries and forces the job into the `BG_JOB_STATE_ERROR` state when an error occurs.
    If the retry period value exceeds the JobInactivityTimeout Group Policy setting (90-day default), BITS cancels the job after the JobInactivityTimeout Group Policy setting is exceeded.

    The default is 1,209,600 seconds (14 days).

- type: <xref href="CostStates" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: TransferPolicy
  description: |+
    Specifies the network cost states in which the transfer is allowed to be scheduled.
    The current cost state of the network is a bitmask that indicates the kinds of charges that would be incurred if a transfer was scheduled at this time.
    This cost state represents a bitmask; if the bit corresponding to the current network cost state is set, the transfer can be scheduled.
    If the bit corresponding to the current network cost state is not set, the transfer is ignored for scheduling purposes.
    You can submit any of the named values listed here, or add them together to provide a custom value.

    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - **Unrestricted** (or unknown) : 0x00000001 : the cost state for this network is not known.

    - **Capped** : 0x00000002 : the cost state for this network is a capped plan, or a plan that has a data usage limit.

    - **BelowCap** : 0x00000004 : the cost state for this network is below the data plan cap.

    - **NearCap** : 0x00000008 : the cost state for this network is near the data plan cap.

    - **OverCapCharged** : 0x00000010 : the cost state for this network is above the data plan cap, and such usage is charged.

    - **OverCapThrottled** : 0x00000020 : the cost state for this network is above the data plan cap, and such usage is throttled.

    - **UsageBased** : 0x00000040 : the cost state for this network is charged based on usage.

    - **Roaming** : 0x00000080 : the cost state for this network incurs roaming charges.
    The cost state also includes one option (IgnoreCongestion) and a set of standard policies (Uncosted, Standard, NoSurcharge, NotRoaming, and Always) which are combinations of the discrete bit values.

    - **IgnoreCongestion** : 0x80000000 : the job can be scheduled even if the network provider reports that the network is congested.

    - **PolicyUnrestricted** : 0x80000021 : the set of cost states that do not consume the quota of a capped plan, or incur extra charges.

    - **Standard** : 0x80000067 : a set of cost states suitable for moderate-priority transfers.

    - **NoSurcharge** : 0x8000006f : the set of cost states that incur no surcharge for use.

    - **NotRoaming** : 0x8000007f : the set of cost states that exclude the roaming state.

    - **Always** : 0x800000ff : the set of all cost states.

    The cost state also includes one option (IgnoreCongestion) and a set of standard policies (Always, NotRoaming, NoSurcharge, Standard, and Uncosted) which are combinations of the discrete bit values.

  The **Start-BitsTransfer** cmdlet creates a Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) transfer job to transfer one or more files between a client computer and a server.
  The *TransferType* parameter specifies the direction of the transfer.
  By default, after the cmdlet begins the transfer, the command prompt is not available until the transfer is complete or until the transfer enters an error state.
  If the state of the returned **BitsJob** object is Error, the error code and description are contained in the object and can be used for analysis.

  The **Start-BitsTransfer** cmdlet supports the download of multiple files from a server to a client computer, but it does not generally support the upload of multiple files from a client computer to a server.
  If you need to upload more than one file, you can use the **Import-Csv** cmdlet to pipe the output to the **Add-BitsFile** cmdlet to upload multiple files.
  Or, if you need to upload more than one file, consider a cabinet file (.cab) or a compressed file (.zip).
