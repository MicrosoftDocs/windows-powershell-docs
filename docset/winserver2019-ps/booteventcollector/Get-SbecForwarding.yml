    The objects contain the fields: 

    - `<TargetEndpoint>`: The target computer's endpoint information in human-readable format, as its host:port string (for example, 127.0.0.1:50000).

    - `<Computer>`: Target computer name, as determined by the collector according to its configuration. 
    - `<ForwarderType>`: Type of the forwarder (such as 'etl'). 
    - `<Destination>`: Destination of the data.
    The meaning depends on the forwarder type.
    A file name (such as for the ETL forwarder), or some other identification. 
    - `<DestinationPattern>`: Pattern used to generate the destination of the data.
    The meaning depends on the forwarder type and configuration.
    For a fixed destination, would be the same as the destination itself.
    For the destination with rotation of the files would contain the pattern characters that will be replaced with the actual index in the destination.
