parameters:
- type: <xref href="Object" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BufferSize
  description: |+
    Specifies the buffer size for the session, in kilobytes.
    This is the size of one buffer, with the count of these buffers set by the *MinimumBufferCount* and *MaximumBufferCount* parameters.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Object" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ClockType
  description: |+
    Specifies the type of clock used for the events collected by this session.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - QueryPerformanceCounter.
    The high-resolution (period of 100 nanoseconds) clock that is typically used for performance measurement. 
    - SystemTime.
    The lower-resolution system time similar to FILETIME (period of 10 milliseconds).
    This value is most typical for the data collection through SBEC.
    - CpuCycleCounter.
    The highest-resolution, with the frequency of the CPU, but may be unreliable depending on the CPU model and the thermal and power modes.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DisableKd
  description: |+
    Changes the LogFileMode flags to disable the forwarding through the kernel transport to the collector for the real-time log sessions.
    The switches *EnableKd* and *DisableKd* are mutually exclusive.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: EnableKd
  description: |+
    Changes the LogFileMode flags to enable the forwarding through the kernel transport to the collector for the real-time log sessions.
    The switches *EnableKd* and *DisableKd* are mutually exclusive.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: FlushSeconds
  description: |+
    Specifies the timeout in seconds for the session buffers to get automatically flushed.
    You can disable the flushing of buffers on timeout by setting this parameter to 0, then the buffers will be written only when full or on an explicit flush.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: FlushTimer
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Object" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: KernelEnableFlags
  description: |+
    Specifies flags for the NT Kernel Logger that enable the kernel events.
    For the setup and boot monitoring, the only reasonable flag is Process.
    This enumeration type is defined in $PsHome\Modules\BootEventCollector\SbecTraceHelpers.psm1.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Process
    - Thread
    - ImageLoad
    - ProcessCounters
    - ContextSwitch
    - Dpc
    - Interrupt
    - SystemCall
    - DiskIO
    - DiskFileIO
    - DiskIOInit
    - Dispatcher
    - MemoryPageFaults
    - MemoryHardFaults
    - VirtualAlloc
    - NetworkTCPIP
    - Registry
    - Alpc
    - SplitIO
    - Driver
    - FileIO
    - FileIOInit
    - Profile

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Object" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: LogFileMode
  description: |+
    Specifies the new flags for the log file mode.
    The parameters *EnableKd* and *DisableKd* are applied on top of these flags.
    This enumeration type is defined in $PsHome\Modules\BootEventCollector\SbecTraceHelpers.psm1.
    The most used bit values in it are: 

    - FileSequential.
    Write events to a log file sequentially; stops when the file reaches its maximum size. 
    - FileCircular.
    Write events to a log file.
    After the file reaches the maximum size, replace the oldest events with incoming events. 
    - FileAppend.
    Append events to an existing sequential log file. 
    - FileNewFile.
    Automatically switch to a new log file when the file reaches the maximum size. 
    - FilePreallocate.
    Reserve the MaximumFileSize of disk space for the log files in advance. 
    - Secure.
    Restrict who can log events to the session to those with TRACELOG_LOG_EVENT permission. 
    - RealTime.
    Deliver the events to consumers in real-time instead of writing them to a file.
    This mode is required for sending the events to the event collector. 
    - KdFilter.
    Forward the events though the kernel channel to the event collector or to the debugger. 
    - UsePagedMemory.
    Use the paged memory for the buffers. 
    - NoPerProcessorBuffering.
    Write the events from all processors to the same buffer.
    This preserves the order of the events, and is recommended for sending the events to the event collector.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MaximumBufferCount
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of buffers to allocate for this session.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: MaximumBuffers, maxbuf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Object" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MaximumFileSize
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum file size after which the session may switch to the next file, in megabytes.
    Use 0 for no limit.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MinimumBufferCount
  description: |+
    Specifies the minimum number of buffers to allocate for this session.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: MinimumBuffers, minbuf
  parameterValueGroup: ""

  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the session to create.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Object" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Path
  description: |+
    Specifies the ETL file where the session will write its log.
    The session must have the file mode enabled to write to a file; a session in the real-time mode ignores the file.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="TraceSessionInfo" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Session
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the GUID for the session.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SimulateError
  description: |+
    Simulates a Windows error in session creation, and causes the function to throw an error.
    You can specify this parameter to test error handling.

  defaultValue: None

  The **Set-SbecLogSession** cmdlet updates the settings for a log session.

  You can change the properties of an object before passing it as input to this cmdlet rather than passing changes as parameters.
  In this case, make sure to set the properties directly in the object rather than in its Trace field (the modifications of Trace are silently ignored by PowerShell).

  The cmdlet parameters that are unused or set to $Null are left unchanged.

  You cannot update the session name.

  The operating system may refuse to change some parameters or silently ignore the updates.
