  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet on the remote computers through a remote session.
    Enter a session object, such as the output of a **New-CimSession** or **Get-CimSession** cmdlet or an array of these objects.

  name: ComputerName
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the computers on which you want to perform the operation.
    You can specify a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), a NetBIOS name, or an IP address.
    For more information see [Invoke-CimMethod](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=808801) on MSDN.

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Direct
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Stops the Setup and Boot Event Collector instance directly through the WMI/CIM interface.
    Specify this parameter to stop an instance of the Setup and Boot Event Collector that was started from a command prompt.

    If multiple instances are running (including the service), specifying this parameter stops a random instance, because WMI connects to a random instance.
    Do not use this parameter with the service, because the service controller interprets it as a service failure and restarts it.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force
  description: |+
    With the *Service* parameter, this parameter acts as a pass-through parameter for **Stop-Service**, allowing the cmdlet to stop a service even if that service has dependent services.
    With *Direct*, requests the fast stopping, discarding the buffered but not yet fully processed data.
