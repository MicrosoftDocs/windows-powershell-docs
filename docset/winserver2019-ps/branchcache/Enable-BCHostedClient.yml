- title: 'Example 1: Enable host cache client mode'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Enable-BCHostedClient -ServerNames "HC.contoso.com" -UseVersion Windows7
  description: |-
    This command enables hosted cache client mode using the HC.contos.com computer as a hosted cache server.
    For HTTPS, use Windows® 7 mode (`Windows7`).

- title: 'Example 2: Enable host cache client mode for two servers'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Enable-BCHostedClient -ServerNames "HC1.contoso.com","HC2.contoso.com" -UseVersion Windows8
  description: |-
    This command enables hosted cache client mode with two hosted cache servers:  HC1.contoso.com and HC2.contoso.com.
    For HTTP, use Windows 8 mode (`Windows8`).

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 

    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt. 
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes. 
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets. 
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimSession" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force
  description: |+
    Forces the command to run without asking for user confirmation.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: ServerNames
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the names of the hosted cache servers that the client computer can use to store content and obtain content.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: UseSCP
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Indicates that the client should locate hosted cache servers by using service connection points (SCP).
    A service connection point is an Active Directory object used to publish service specific data.
    A hosted cache server may register a service connection point object associated with the active directory site in which it resides.
    This is achieved with the *RegisterSCP* parameter on the **Enable-BCHostedServer** cmdlet.

    If this parameter is specified, then this computer attempts to automatically discover a hosted cache server associated with the assigned active directory site by searching for an SCP.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="HostedCacheVersion" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: UseVersion
  description: |+
    Specifies the version of the offer protocol to use when contacting this hosted cache server.

    This parameter controls which protocol the client should use when communicating with the hosted cache server.
    The value `Windows8` specifies that the client uses HTTP.
    The value `Windows7` specifies that the client uses HTTPS. 
    If this parameter is not specified, and a hosted cache server name is provided, then a value of `Windows8` is used. 
    If the *UseSCP* parameter is used, then a value of `Windows7` is used.

    Hosted cache servers that are running Windows Server® 2012 do not need to enroll a certificate, and client computers can contact these servers to store or obtain content by using the HTTP protocol on the TCP port `80`.
    However, Windows® 7-based hosted cache servers must have a certificate enrolled, and can only be contacted when client computers use the HTTPS protocol on the TCP port `443`.

    Note: Windows® 7-based computers can only contact hosted cache servers by using the HTTPS protocol; because of this, a hosted cache server that is running Windows Server 2012 can be configured to accept requests over both HTTP and HTTPS so that the hosted cache server can operate with Windows® 7-based computers and with client computers that are running Windows® 8.
