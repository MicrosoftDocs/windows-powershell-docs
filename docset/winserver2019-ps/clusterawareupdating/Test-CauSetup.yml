  The **Test-CauSetup** cmdlet tests whether a failover cluster is properly set up to apply software updates using Cluster-Aware Updating (CAU).
  The cmdlet performs a Best Practices Analyzer (BPA) scan of the failover cluster and network environment by invoking the ClusterAwareUpdating BPA model that is installed with CAU.
  To view the results of a BPA scan that is performed by **Test-CauSetup**, including possible problems and resolution steps, run the **Get-BpaResult** cmdlet.

  You must run the **Test-CauSetup** cmdlet with local administrative credentials.
