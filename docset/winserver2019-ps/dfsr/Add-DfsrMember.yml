    This command adds the computer named SRV07 to replication group named RG01.
    The console displays the new **DfsrMember** object.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 2: Add multiple members to a new group'
  code: |-
    The first command creates a replication group, specifies a replicated folder, and adds three computers to the group as members. The command creates a replication group named River Branch Office by using the **New-DfsReplicationGroup** cmdlet. The command passes the new group to the **New-DfsReplicatedFolder** cmdlet by using the pipeline operator. That cmdlet creates a replicated folder named Data Distribution 01. The command adds three computers, named SRV01, SRV02, and SRV03, to the new replication group.
    PS C:\> New-DfsReplicationGroup -GroupName "River Branch Office" | New-DfsReplicatedFolder -FolderName "Data Distribution 01" | Add-DfsrMember -ComputerName "SRV01","SRV02","SRV03" | Format-Table dnsname,groupname -auto -wrap
    DnsName                GroupName
    -------                ---------
    SRV01.corp.contoso.com River Branch Office
    SRV02.corp.contoso.com River Branch Office
    SRV03.corp.contoso.com River Branch Office

    The second command adds a connection between the source computer named SRV01 and the destination computer named SRV02 by using the **Add-DfsrConnection** cmdlet.
    PS C:\> Add-DfsrConnection -GroupName "River Branch Office" -SourceComputerName "SRV01" -DestinationComputerName "SRV02" | Format-Table *name -wrap -auto
    GroupName           SourceComputerName  DestinationComputerName
    ---------           ------------------  -----------------------
    River Branch Office SRV01               SRV02
    River Branch Office SRV02               SRV01

    The third command adds a connection between the source computer named SRV01 and the destination computer named SRV03.
    PS C:\> Add-DfsrConnection -GroupName "River Branch Office" -SourceComputerName "SRV01" -DestinationComputerName "SRV03" | Format-Table *name -wrap -auto
    GroupName           SourceComputerName  DestinationComputerName
    ---------           ------------------  -----------------------
    River Branch Office SRV01               SRV03
    River Branch Office SRV03               SRV01

    The fourth command makes the computer named SRV01 the primary member of the group by using the **Set-DfsrMembership** cmdlet. The command also specifies Data Distribution 01 as the name of the replicated folder in the location C:\RF01. The command specifies the staging folder quota as 16384 MB. The command includes the *Force* parameter, and, therefore, does not prompt the user for confirmation. 
    PS C:\> Set-DfsrMembership -GroupName "River Branch Office" -FolderName "Data Distribution 01" -ContentPath "C:\RF01" -ComputerName "SRV01" -PrimaryMember $True -StagingPathQuotaInMB 16384 -Force | Format-Table *name,*path,primary* -auto -wrap
    DomainName       GroupName           FolderName           ComputerName  ContentPath StagingPath                PrimaryMember
    ----------       ---------           ----------           ------------  ----------- -----------                -------------
    corp.contoso.com River Branch Office Data Distribution 01 SRV01         C:\RF01     C:\RF01\DfsrPrivate\Staging         True

    The fifth command modifies values for the computers named SRV02 and SRV03. The command specifies Data Distribution 01 as the name of the replicated folder in the location C:\RF01. The command specifies the staging folder quota as 16384 MB. The command includes the *Force* parameter, and, therefore, does not prompt the user for confirmation.Unlike the previous command, this command does not specify a value of the *PrimaryMember* parameter. The computers named SRV02 and SRV03 have the default value of $False for the setting.
    PS C:\> Set-DfsrMembership -GroupName "River Branch Office" -FolderName "Data Distribution 1" -ContentPath "C:\RF01" -ComputerName "SRV02","SRV03" -StagingPathQuotaInMB 16384 -Force | Format-Table *name,*path,primary* -auto -wrap
    DomainName       GroupName           FolderName           ComputerName  ContentPath StagingPath                PrimaryMember
    ----------       ---------           ----------           ------------  ----------- -----------                -------------
    corp.contoso.com River Branch Office Data Distribution 01 SRV02         C:\RF01     C:\RF01\DfsrPrivate\Staging        False
    corp.contoso.com River Branch Office Data Distribution 01 SRV03         C:\RF01     C:\RF01\DfsrPrivate\Staging        False

    This example sets up a replication group called River Branch Office.
    The group consists of three computers, a primary member named SRV01 and two other computers named SRV02 and SRV03.
    The example specifies a replication folder and establishes connections between the members.
    The example also specifies the maximum size of the staging folder.

    Each command returns the appropriate object or objects.
    This example uses the **Format-Table** cmdlet to format output in the console.
    For more information, type `Get-Help Format-Table`.
