    This command looks for conflicting or deleted files that have a name that contains the string canary.
    The command gets the preserved files recorded in the specified manifest.
    The command then passes those files to the **Where-Object** cmdlet by using the pipeline operator.
    That cmdlet passes files that match the criteria back to the console.
    For more information, type `Get-Help Where-Object`.

    In this example, the command finds a file, named canary.bmp.
    You could use the Restore-DfsrPreservedFiles to restore this file.

  The **Get-DfsrPreservedFiles** cmdlet gets a list of preserved files and folders.
  The Distributed File System (DFS) Replication service preserves the following kinds of files and folders: 

  - Conflicted.
  If users make changes to the same file on multiple servers before replication converges, a file might conflict with the current version.
  DFS Replication preserves previous conflicting versions of the file.
  - Deleted.
  When a member computer deletes a replicated file, other members also remove that file.
  Depending on membership settings, computers can preserve deleted files.
  To modify whether a member computer preserves deleted files, use the **Set-DfsrMembership** cmdlet. 
  - Preexisting.
  If DFS Replication overwrites files during its initial synchronization, DFS Replication preserves those files.

  For all three types, DFS Replication moves the files and folders to \<replicated folder\>\DfsrPrivate\ConflictsAndDeleted or \<replicated folder\>\DfsrPrivate\Preexisting.
  DFS Replication records these files in a manifest, either ConflictAndDeletedManifest.xml or PreexistingManifest.xml, as appropriate.
  Specify the ConflictAndDeletedManifest.xml manifest to view conflicted and deleted files and folders.
  Specify the PreexistingManifest.xml manifest to view preexisting files and folders.
  You can use the **Restore-DfsrPreservedFiles** cmdlet to restore files and folders.
