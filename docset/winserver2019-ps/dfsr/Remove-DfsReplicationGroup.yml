  The **Remove-DfsReplicationGroup** cmdlet removes a replication group.

  When you remove a replication group, you remove the group from Active Directory, and you also delete all associated aspects of the Distributed File System (DFS) Replication topology for that replication group, such as members, memberships, and connections.
  All replication halts on all members.
  This operation does not delete any replicated file data or private data.
  Use this command only when you decommission a replication group.
