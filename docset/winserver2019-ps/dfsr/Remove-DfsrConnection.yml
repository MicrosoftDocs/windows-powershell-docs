description: |-
  The **Remove-DfsrConnection** cmdlet removes a connection between members of a replication group.
  After you remove the connections between a pair of server, the Distributed File System (DFS) Replication service cannot replicate data between the servers.
  You should always delete connections bidirectionally between two servers.
  Run this cmdlet for the receiving computer and the sending computer.

  DFS Replication connections are the logical partnerships between members in a replication group.
  The DFS Replication service uses the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) protocol to communicate between servers.
