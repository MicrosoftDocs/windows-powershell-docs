  description: |-
    This command changes the settings of a connection between the computers named SRV01 and SRV02 in the RG24 replication group.
    The command specifies that the connection no longer uses Remote Differential Compression or Cross-File RDC from SRV01 to SRV02.
    The administrator has determined that the network that connects these servers is a high-bandwidth LAN that should replicate faster than low-bandwidth WAN connections.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Description
  description: |+
    Specifies a description for the connection.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "6"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DestinationComputerName
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the receiving computer.
    A receiving computer is also called an inboard or downstream computer.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "2"
  aliases: ReceivingMember, RMem
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DisableConnection
  description: |+
    Specifies that the DFS Replication service disables the connection.

    You do not typically need to disable a connection.
    Specify this parameter to temporarily pause replication.
    You can also use the **Suspend-DfsReplicationGroup** cmdlet to halt replication between computers.
    You must enable a connection between the computers before the DFS Replication service can initiate replication.

    Important: Specify this parameter instead of disabling a computer's membership in the replication group by using the **Set-DfsrMembership** cmdlet.
    Disabling and enabling the membership of a computer causes non-authoritative inbound replication.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "3"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DisableCrossFileRDC
  description: |+
    Indicates that the DFS Replication service disables the cross-file similarity Remote Differential Compression (RDC) algorithm on this connection.

    Cross-file RDC uses up to five existing previously replicated files on a volume to seed a new replicating file.
    Applying cross-file RDC over very low-bandwidth network connections with files that are very similar results in very large bandwidth savings and potentially large time savings.
    When you use cross-file RDC on very high-bandwidth network connections, cross-file RDC may add too much local processing time and negatively affect performance.
    In extremely large datasets (millions of files on a volume with a great deal of similarity), cross-file RDC may also negatively affect CPU and disk utilization.
    Consider disabling cross-file RDC when you replicate over LANs and very high performance WANs. 
    This setting is only supported on Windows Server 2012 R2 and later.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "5"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DisableRDC
  description: |+
    Indicates that the DFS Replication service creates the connection with Remote Differential Compression (RDC) disabled.

    You do not typically need to specify this parameter when you use lower bandwidth, higher latency connections.
    Consider specifying this parameter if the connection is over a LAN or very high performance WAN connection.
    By default, RDC is enabled on DFS Replication connections.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "4"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainName
  description: |+
    Specifies the NetBIOS name or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the Active Directory Domain Service (AD DS) domain that contains the replication group.
    If you do not specify this parameter, the cmdlet uses the domain of the current user.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "100"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: GroupName
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of names of replication groups.
    You can use a comma separated list and the wildcard character (*).

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: RG, RgName
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int64" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MinimumRDCFileSizeInKB
  description: |+
    Specifies the file size threshold, in Kilobytes, for RDC to apply.

    You do not typically need to specify this parameter when you use lower bandwidth/higher latency connections.
    Consider specifying this parameter only if the connection is over a LAN or a very high performance WAN connection.
    By default, any files equal to or greater than 64KB are chunked by RDC.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "7"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SourceComputerName
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the sending computer.
    A sending computer is also called an outbound or upstream computer.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: SendingMember, SMem
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: wi
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: DFSR.Set-DfsrConnection
name: Set-DfsrConnection
description: |-
  The **Set-DfsrConnection** cmdlet changes a connection between two members of a replication group.

  Distributed File System (DFS) Replication connections are the logical partnerships between members in a replication group.
  The DFS Replication service uses the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) protocol to communicate between servers.
  The DFS Replication service does not support modifying connection bandwidth or schedules, which typically do not require changes.
