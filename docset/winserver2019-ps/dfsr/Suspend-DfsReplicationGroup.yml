  name: DestinationComputerName
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the receiving computer.
    A destination computer is also called an inbound or downstream computer.
    This computer overrides its schedule and stops inbound replication.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "2"
  aliases: ReceivingMember, RMem
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DurationInMinutes
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the number of minutes to suspend replication.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "3"
  aliases: Time
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: GroupName
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of names of replication groups.
    If you do not specify this parameter, the cmdlet queries for all participating replications groups.
    You can use a comma separated list and the wildcard character (*).

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: RG, RgName
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SourceComputerName
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the sending computer.
    A source computer is also called an outbound or upstream computer.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: SendingMember, SMem
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"

name: Suspend-DfsReplicationGroup
description: |-
  The **Suspend-DfsReplicationGroup** cmdlet suspends replication between computers, even if replication was scheduled by either a replication group or a connection.

  This cmdlet ignores the schedule for a specified number of minutes.
  This is typically preferable to altering the schedule temporarily to prevent replication, because this cmdlet does not require Active Directory replication and LDAP polling.
