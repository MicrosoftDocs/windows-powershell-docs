parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job.
    Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 
    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt.
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes.
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets.
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 
    For more information about Windows PowerShell® background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

name: Add-DhcpServerv4Failover
description: |-
  The **Add-DhcpServerv4Failover** cmdlet adds a new IPv4 failover relationship to a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server service.
  You can add a failover relationship with load balance mode or in hot-standby mode.

  This cmdlet creates the failover relationship on both of the DHCP server services that use the specified parameters.
  The *ScopeId* parameter value specified on the source DHCP server service, or local computer that runs the DHCP server service is identically setup on the partner DHCP server service.

  If the *SharedSecret* parameter is specified, message digest authentication will be automatically turned on for the newly created failover relationship.

  By default, user confirmation will be sought if the *SharedSecret* parameter is specified.
