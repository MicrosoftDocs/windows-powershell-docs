  code: |-
    PS C:\> Add-DhcpServerv4Filter -List Allow -MacAddress "F0-DE-F1-7A-00-5E" -Description "Laptop 09"
  description: |-
    This example adds the specified client identified by the MAC address to the allowed list of MAC address filters.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 2: Add multiple clients to the allowed filter'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Add-DhcpServerv4Filter -List Allow -MacAddress "F0-DE-F1-7A-00-5E", "F0-DE-F1-7A-00-5C"
  description: |-
    This example adds the specified clients identified by their MAC address to the allowed list of MAC address filters.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 3: Add address filters from a file'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Import-Csv -Path "MacAddressFilters.csv" | Add-DhcpServerv4Filter -ComputerName "dhcpserver.contoso.com" -List Allow
  description: |-
    This example adds all of the MAC address filters in the file that is named MacAddressFilters.csv to the allow MAC address list of the DHCP server service running on the computer named dhcpserver.contoso.com.
    The **Import-Csv** cmdlet returns the objects that have Mac address filter fields that are piped to this cmdlet, which in turn adds the MAC address filters to the server.
    The file that is named MacAddressFilters.csv should be in the following comma-separated values (CSV) format:

    `MacAddress,Description`

    `1a-1b-1c-1d-1e-1f,Computer1`

    `2a-2b-2c-2d-2e-2f,Computer2`

    `3a-3b-3c-3d-3e-3f,Computer3`

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job.
    Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 
    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt.
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes.
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets.
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 
    For more information about Windows PowerShell® background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ComputerName

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Description
  description: |+

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force
  description: |+
    Specifies that, if one or more of the MAC addresses are already present in the allow or deny list, the matching MAC addresses are deleted and the new entries created.

    This parameter is useful in the case where the MAC address specified is already present in one list, such as the allow list, and the same MAC address now has to be added to the other list, such as the deny list.

    If this parameter is not specified, the cmdlet fails if the specified MAC address is already present in any of the lists.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: List
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the list to which one or more MAC addresses are to be added.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are: Allow or Deny.

  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
