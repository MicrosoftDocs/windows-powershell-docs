- title: 'Example 4: Delete reserved IP addresses from all scopes'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Get-DhcpServerv4Scope -ComputerName "dhcpserver.contoso.com" | Remove-DhcpServerv4Reservation -ComputerName "dhcpserver.contoso.com"
  description: |-
    This example deletes all of the reserved IP addresses from all of the scopes on the DHCP server service that runs on the computer named dhcpserver.contoso.com.
    The **Get-DhcpServerv4Scope** cmdlet returns all of the scope objects and pipes the objects into this cmdlet, which deletes the reservations from each scope passed in through the pipeline.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job.
    Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 
    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt.
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes.
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets.
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 
    For more information about Windows PowerShell® background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).
