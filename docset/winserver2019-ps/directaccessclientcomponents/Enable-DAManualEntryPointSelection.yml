parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 

    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt. 
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes. 
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets. 
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

description: |-
  The **Enable-DAManualEntryPointSelection** cmdlet enables a user to manually choose which DirectAccess entry point to use for connectivity.
  This cmdlet succeeds only when the client computer is outside of the corporate network perimeter, and DirectAccess is deployed.

  Computers configured for multisite DirectAccess automatically pick the best entry point to use for connectivity.
  A user might want to override the entry point that is automatically selected; for example, to help troubleshoot network connectivity.
  This cmdlet allows a user to manually choose a DirectAccess entry point.

  You can prevent a user from overriding the automatic selection by using Group Policy.
  For more information about using Group Policy to restrict automatic selection changes, see **Get-DAClientExperienceConfiguration**.
