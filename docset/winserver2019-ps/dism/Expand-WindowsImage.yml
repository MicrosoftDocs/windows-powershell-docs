parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ApplyPath
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the location where the image is to be applied.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CheckIntegrity
  description: |+
    Detects and tracks .wim file corruption when used with the **Add-WindowsImage**, **Dismount-WindowsImage**, or **Save-WindowsImage** cmdlet.
    CheckIntegrity stops the operation if DISM detects that the .wim file is corrupted when used with the **Expand-WindowsImage** or **Mount-WindowsImage** cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Compact
  description: |+
    Indicates that this cmdlet applies the operating system image to the specified drive with individual operating system files compressed.
    If you do not specify this parameter, this cmdlet lays down all of the files in the image without compression.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ConfirmTrustedFile
  description: |+
    Specifies that this cmdlet validates the image for Trusted Desktop on a Windows® 8 or Windows® 8.1.
    This option can only be run on a computer running at least Windows® Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE) 4.0.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ImagePath
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the location of a WIM file.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Index
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the index number of a Windows image in a WIM or VHD file.
    For a VHD file, the Index must be 1.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="LogLevel" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: LogLevel
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum output level shown in the logs.
    The default log level is 3.
    The accepted values are as follows:
    - 1 = Errors only
    - 2 = Errors and warnings
    - 3 = Errors, warnings, and information
    - 4 = All of the information listed previously, plus debug output

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: LL
  parameterValueGroup: Errors, Warnings, WarningsInfo
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: LogPath
  description: |+
    Specifies the full path and file name to log to.
    If not set, the default is `%WINDIR%\Logs\Dism\dism.log`.
    In Windows PE, the default directory is the RAMDISK scratch space which can be as low as 32 MB.
    The log file will automatically be archived.
    The archived log file will be saved with .bak appended to the file name and a new log file will be generated.
    Each time the log file is archived the .bak file will be overwritten. 
    When using a network share that is not joined to a domain, use the net use command together with domain credentials to set access permissions before you set the log path for the DISM log.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: LP
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of an image in a WIM file.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: NoRpFix
  description: |+
    Disables the reparse point tag fix.
    A reparse point is a file that contains a link to another file on the file system.
    If the parameter is not specified, reparse points that resolve to paths outside of the value specified by the *ImagePath* parameter will not be captured.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ScratchDirectory
  description: |+
    Specifies a temporary directory that will be used when extracting files for use during servicing.
    The directory must exist locally.
    If not specified, the `\Windows\%Temp%` directory will be used, with a subdirectory name of a randomly generated hexadecimal value for each run of DISM.
    Items in the scratch directory are deleted after each operation. 
    You should not use a network share location as a scratch directory to expand a package (.cab or .msu file) for installation.
    The directory used for extracting files for temporary usage during servicing should be a local directory.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SplitImageFilePattern
  description: |+
    Specifies the location and name of the base split image file.

  defaultValue: None

  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Verify
  description: |+
    Checks for errors and file duplication. 
     During an apply operation, for example, using the **Add-WindowsImage** cmdlet, the size and the hash of the file being applied are checked against the image file to verify they are both equal. 
     During a capture operation, for example, when using the **New-WindowsImage** cmdlet, after the files is captured into a Windows image, the file is written to a temporary file and compared on a bit-by-bit basis with the original file.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WIMBoot
