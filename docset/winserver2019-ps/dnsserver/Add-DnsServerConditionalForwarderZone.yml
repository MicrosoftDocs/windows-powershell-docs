parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 

    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt. 
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes. 
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets. 
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimSession" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ComputerName
  description: |+
    Specifies the DNS server.
    The cmdlet adds the forwarder to this server.
    If you do not specify this parameter, the command runs on the local system.
    You can specify an IP address or any value that resolves to an IP address, such as a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), host name, or NETBIOS name.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Cn
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DirectoryPartitionName
  description: |+
    Specifies a directory partition on which to store the forwarder.
    Conditional forwarders are internally stored as zones.
    Use this parameter when the *ReplicationScope* parameter has a value of Custom.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ForwarderTimeout
  description: |+
    Specifies a length of time, in seconds, that a DNS server waits for a master server to resolve a query.
    If a server does not resolve the request, the next server in the list is queried until all master servers are queried.
    After this period, the DNS server can attempt to resolve the query itself.
    This parameter applies only to the forwarder zone.
    The minimum value is 0.
    The maximum value is 15.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "3"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: LoadExisting
  description: |+
    Indicates that the server loads existing data for the forwarder from the registry.
    Conditional forwarders are internally stored as zones.
    This parameter is not valid for Active Directory-integrated zones.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="IPAddress" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: MasterServers
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of IP addresses of the master servers of the zone.
    DNS queries for a forwarded zone are sent to master servers.
    You can use both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
    You must specify at least one master server.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "2"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of a zone.
    The cmdlet adds a conditional forwarder for this zone.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ZoneName
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PassThru
  description: |+
    Returns an object representing the item with which you are working.
    By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ReplicationScope
  description: |+
    Specifies the replication scope for the conditional forwarder.
    Conditional forwarders are stored internally as zones.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Custom.
    Replicate the conditional forwarder to all DNS servers running on domain controllers enlisted in a custom directory partition.
    - Domain.
    Replicate the conditional forwarder to all DNS servers that run on domain controllers in the domain.
    - Forest.
    Replicate the conditional forwarder to all DNS servers that run on domain controllers in the forest.
    - Legacy.
    Replicate the conditional forwarder to all domain controllers in the domain.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Forest, Domain, Legacy, Custom
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: UseRecursion
  description: |+
    Specifies whether a DNS server attempts to resolve a query after the forwarder fails to resolve it.
    A value of $False prevents a DNS server from attempting resolution using other DNS servers.
    This parameter overrides the Use Recursion setting for a DNS server.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"

  aliases: wi
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: DnsServer.Add-DnsServerConditionalForwarderZone
name: Add-DnsServerConditionalForwarderZone
description: |-
  The **Add-DnsServerConditionalForwarderZone** cmdlet adds a conditional forwarder to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.
  You can select the master servers, forwarder time-out, recursion, host computer, replication scope, and directory partition for the conditional forwarder.
  Conditional forwarders are stored as zones on a DNS server.
