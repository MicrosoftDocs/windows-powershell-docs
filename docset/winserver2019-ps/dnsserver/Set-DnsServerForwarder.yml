parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 

    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt. 
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes. 
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets. 
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="CimSession" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ComputerName
  description: |+
    Specifies a remote DNS server.
    You can specify an IP address or any value that resolves to an IP address, such as a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), host name, or NETBIOS name.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Cn
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: EnableReordering
  description: |+
    Specifies whether to enable the DNS server to reorder forwarders dynamically.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="IPAddress" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: IPAddress
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of IP addresses of DNS servers where queries are forwarded.
    Specify the forwarders in the order that you want them to be configured.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PassThru
  description: |+
    Returns an object representing the item with which you are working.
    By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Timeout
  description: |+
    Specifies the number of seconds that the DNS server waits for a response from the forwarder.
    The minimum value is 0, and the maximum value is 15.
    The default value is 5.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: UseRootHint
  description: |+
    Specifies whether to prevent the DNS server from performing iterative queries.
    If you set **UseRootHint** to $false, the DNS server forwards unresolved queries only to the DNS servers in the forwarders list and does not try iterative queries if the forwarders do not resolve the queries.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"

  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: DnsServer.Set-DnsServerForwarder
name: Set-DnsServerForwarder
description: |-
  The **Set-DnsServerForwarder** cmdlet changes forwarder settings on a Domain Name System (DNS) server.
  This cmdlet sets or resets IP addresses to which the DNS server forwards DNS queries when it cannot solve them locally.
  This cmdlet overwrites existing server level forwarders.

  Setting IP addresses by using this cmdlet causes the DNS server to perform recursive queries to the DNS servers at the specified IP addresses.
  By default, the DNS server waits five seconds for a response from one forwarder IP address before it tries another forwarder IP address.
  You can use the *Timeout* parameter to change the number of seconds that the DNS server waits.
  When the server has exhausted all forwarders, it attempts standard recursion.
  By default, a DNS server performs iterative queries when it cannot resolve a query.
