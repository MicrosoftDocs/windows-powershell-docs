parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 

    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt. 
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes. 
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets. 
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

  defaultValue: None

  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ComputerName
  description: |+
    Specifies a remote DNS server.
    You can specify an IP address or any value that resolves to an IP address, such as a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), host name, or NetBIOS name.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Cn
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ErrorsPerSec
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of times that the server can send an error response to a client within a one-second interval.
    The error responses include: REFUSED, FORMERR and SERVFAIL

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force
  description: |+
    Forces the command to run without asking for user confirmation.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IPv4PrefixLength
  description: |+
    Specifies the IPv4 prefix length, which indicates the size of the subnet in which the incoming queries are grouped.
    The server applies RRL if queries resulting in the same response occur more frequently than expected in a specified time window.
    The default value of this parameter is 24.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IPv6PrefixLength
  description: |+
    Specifies the IPv6 prefix length, which indicates the size of the IPv6 subnet in which the incoming queries are grouped.
    The server applies RRL if queries resulting in the same response occur more frequently than expected in a specified time window.
    The default value of this parameter is 56.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: LeakRate
  description: |+
    Specifies the rate at which the server responds to dropped queries.
    For queries that meet criteria to be dropped due to RRL, the DNS server still responds once per *LeakRate* queries.
    For example, if *LeakRate* is 3, the server responds to one in every 3 queries.
    The allowed range for LeakRate is 2 to 10.
    If *LeakRate* is set to zero, then no responses are 'leaked' by RRL.
    *LeakRate* leaves a chance for the victims in the same subnet as the forged IP address to get responses to their valid queries.
    The default value for *LeakRate* is 3.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MaximumResponsesPerWindow
  description: ""
  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Mode
  description: |+
    Specifies the state of RRL on the DNS server.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are: Enable, or Disable, or LogOnly.
    If the mode is set to LogOnly the DNS server performs all the RRL calculations but instead of taking the preventive actions (dropping or truncating responses), it only logs the potential actions as if RRL were enabled and continues with the normal responses.
    The default value is Enable.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: LogOnly, Enable, Disable
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PassThru
  description: |+
    Returns an object representing the item with which you are working.
    By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ResetToDefault
  description: |+
    Indicates that this cmdlet sets all the RRL settings to their default values.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ResponsesPerSec
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of times that the server sends a client the same response within a one-second interval.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: TruncateRate
  description: |+
    Specifies the rate at which the server responds with truncated responses.
    For queries that meet the criteria to be dropped due to RRL, the DNS server still responds with truncated responses once per *TruncateRate* queries.
    For example, if *TruncateRate* is 2, one in every 2 queries receives a truncated response.
    The *TruncateRate* parameter provides the valid clients a way to reconnect using TCP.
    The allowed range for TruncateRate is 2 to 10.
    If it is set to 0, then this behaviour is disabled.
    The default value is 2.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: wi
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WindowInSec
  description: |+
    Specifies the period (in seconds) over which rates are measured and averaged for RRL.
    RRL is applied if queries from same subnet, resulting in same response, occur more frequently than expected in a specified time window.
    The default value is 5.
