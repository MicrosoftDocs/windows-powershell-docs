    PS C:\> Start-DnsServerZoneTransfer -Name "contoso.com"
  description: |-
    This command starts a zone transfer on the local DNS server for the secondary zone named contoso.com.
    The command does not use the *FullTransfer* parameter, so it performs an incremental transfer.
  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 

    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt. 
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes. 
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets. 
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ComputerName
  description: |+
    Specifies a DNS server.
    If you do not specify this parameter, the command runs on the local system.
    You can specify an IP address or any value that resolves to an IP address, such as a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), Hostname, or NETBIOS name.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Cn
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: FullTransfer
  description: |+
    Specifies that this cmdlet performs a full transfer.
    Without this parameter, the cmdlet does an incremental transfer.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name

    Specifies the name of a zone.
    The cmdlet transfers records for this zone.

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PassThru
  description: |+
    Returns an object representing the item with which you are working.
    By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

uid: DnsServer.Start-DnsServerZoneTransfer
name: Start-DnsServerZoneTransfer
description: |-
  The **Start-DnsServerZoneTransfer** cmdlet starts a zone transfer of a secondary zone from the master servers.
  You can do a full transfer, where the secondary Domain Name System (DNS) server gets a copy of all the resource records for the zone.
  You can also do an incremental transfer, where the secondary DNS server gets new and changed resource records.

  A zone transfer forces a check of the version number in the master server Start of Authority (SOA) record.
  If the version number on the master server is higher than the secondary server version number, then a zone transfer begins that updates the secondary server.
  If the version number is the same, no zone transfer begins.
