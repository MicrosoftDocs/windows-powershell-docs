  code: |-
    PS C:\> New-Cluster -Name cluster1 -Node node1,node2,node3,node4

    Name 
    ---- 
    cluster1
  description: |-
    This example creates a four-node cluster named cluster1, using default settings for IP addressing.

- title: Example 2
  code: |-
    PS C:\> New-Cluster -Name cluster1 -Node node1,node2 -NoStorage

    Name 
    ---- 
    cluster1
  description: |-
    This example creates a two-node cluster named cluster1.
    The cluster will not have any clustered storage, or disk resources.
    Storage can be added using the **Get-ClusterAvailableDisk** cmdlet with the **Add-ClusterDisk** cmdlet.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="AdminAccessPoint" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AdministrativeAccessPoint
  description: |+
    Specifies the type of administrative access point that the cmdlet creates for the cluster.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - ActiveDirectoryAndDns.
    The cmdlet creates an administrative access point for the cluster.
    The administrative access point is registered in DNS and enabled in Active Directory Domain Services.
    - Dns.
    The cmdlet creates an administrative access point for the cluster.
    The administrative access point is registered in DNS but is not enabled in Active Directory Domain Services.
    - None.
    The cmdlet does not create an administrative access point for the cluster.
    Some clustered roles and functionality might not be available for a cluster that does not have an administrative access point.
    Also, you cannot use Failover Cluster Manager to manage a cluster that does not have an administrative access point.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: aap
  parameterValueGroup: None, ActiveDirectoryAndDns, Dns, ActiveDirectory
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force
  description: |+
    Forces the command to run without asking for user confirmation.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="StringCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IgnoreNetwork
  description: |+
    Specifies one or more networks to ignore when running the cmdlet.
    Networks with DHCP enabled are always included, but other networks need a static address to be specified using the **StaticAddress** parameter or should be explicitly ignored with this **IgnoreNetwork** parameter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="AdminAccessPointResType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ManagementPointNetworkType
  description: |+
    Specifies the network configuration used to determine IP address settings.

    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Automatic: Automatically detects the appropriate setting. If SQL Server is running in Azure, uses `Distributed`. If SQL Server is running on-premises, uses `Singleton`. (Default setting)
    - Singleton: The traditional method of DHCP or static IP address.
    - Distributed: Uses a Distributed Network Name by using Node IP addresses.

  defaultValue: Automatic
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the cluster to create.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="StringCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Node
  description: |+
    Specifies a comma-separated list of cluster node names, or server names, on which to create the cluster.
    If this parameter is not specified, then a one node cluster is created on the local physical computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: NoStorage
  description: |+
    Specifies that shared storage is ignored during the cluster creation.
    The cluster created at the end of the operation will not have shared storage.
    Shared storage can later be added by piping the **ClusterDiskInfo** object from the **Get-ClusterAvailableDisk** cmdlet into the **Add-ClusterDisk** cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: S2D
  description: |+
    Specifies whether to enable Storage Spaces Direct when creating the cluster.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="StringCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: StaticAddress
  description: |+
    Specifies one or more static addresses to use when running the cmdlet.
    Networks with DHCP enabled are always included, but other networks need a static address to be specified using the **StaticAddress** parameter or should be explicitly ignored with this **IgnoreNetwork** parameter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: FailoverClusters.New-Cluster
name: New-Cluster
description: |-
  The **New-Cluster** cmdlet creates a new failover cluster.
  Before creating a cluster, the hardware (servers, networks, and storage) must be connected, and the validation tests must be run.

  Use Test-Cluster to run the validation tests.
  The tests will confirm that the hardware and settings are compatible with failover clustering.
  There are multiple types of tests, including Inventory, System Configuration, Network, Storage, and other types of tests.
