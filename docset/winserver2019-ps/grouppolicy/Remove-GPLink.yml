    This command removes the links for all the GPOs that are linked to the MyOU organizational unit in the contoso.com domain.

    This cmdlet is used to get a **Microsoft.GroupPolicy.Som** object for the OU.
    The GpoLinks property of the SOM object contains all the GPO links for GPOs that are linked to the OU.
    Links that are inherited from higher-level containers are not included.
    This collection is piped into **Remove-GPLink**.
    The GPOs for which links have been removed are returned.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"

  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Domain
  description: |+
    Specifies the domain for this cmdlet.
    You must specify the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the domain.

    For the **Remove-GPLink** cmdlet:

    - The GPO that is linked must exist in this domain.

    - The Active Directory container (site, domain, or OU) that is linked must exist in a domain that has a trust relationship with this domain.

    Note: To specify a domain to link to, use the Target parameter.

    If you do not specify the Domain parameter, the domain of the user that is running the current session is used.
    If the cmdlet is being run from a computer startup or shutdown script, the domain of the computer is used.
    For more information, see the Notes section in the full Help.

    If you specify a domain that is different from the domain of the user that is running the current session (or, for a startup or shutdown script, the computer), a trust must exist between that domain and the domain of the user, or the computer.

    You can also refer to the *Domain* parameter by its built-in alias, domainname.
    For more information, see about_Aliases.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: DomainName
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Guid" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />

    You can use the *Guid* parameter to uniquely identify a GPO.

    You can also refer to the *Name* parameter by its built-in alias, displayname.
    For more information, see **about_Aliases**.
