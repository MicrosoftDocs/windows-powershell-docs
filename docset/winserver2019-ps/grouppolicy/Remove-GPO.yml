### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Removes a GPO.
module: GroupPolicy
notes: |-
  * When you remove a GPO, by default, all links to that GPO in the domain of the GPO are deleted. To remove a link to a GPO, you must have permission to link Group Policy Objects for the organizational unit or domain. If you do not have rights to delete a link, the GPO is deleted, but the link remains. Links from other domains and sites are not removed. The link to a deleted GPO appears in the GPMC as Not Found. To remove Not Found links, you must either have permission on the site, domain, or organizational unit containing the link, or ask someone with sufficient rights to delete it.
