### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Grants a level of permissions to a security principal for one GPO or all the GPOs in a domain.
module: GroupPolicy
notes: |-
  * You can use the *DomainName* parameter to explicitly specify the domain for this cmdlet.

    If you do not explicitly specify the domain, the cmdlet uses a default domain.
  The default domain is the domain that is used to access network resources by the security context under which the current session is running.
  This domain is typically the domain of the user that is running the session.
  For example, the domain of the user who started the session by opening Windows PowerShell from the Program Files menu, or the domain of a user that is specified in a runas command.
  However, computer startup and shutdown scripts run under the context of the LocalSystem account.
  The LocalSystem account is a built-in local account, and it accesses network resources under the context of the computer account.
  Therefore, when this cmdlet is run from a startup or shutdown script, the default domain is the domain to which the computer is joined.

- title: 'Example 1: Set the permission level for a security group belonging to a GPO'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Set-GPPermission -Name TestGpo -TargetName "Domain Users" -TargetType Group -PermissionLevel GpoRead
  description: |-
    This command sets the permission level for the Domain Users security group to GpoRead for the GPO named TestGpo.
    Because the *Replace* parameter is not specified, if the group already has a permission level higher than GpoRead, such as GpoEdit, no action is taken.

- title: 'Example 2: Set the permission level for a security group that belongs to all GPOs'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Set-GPPermission -All -TargetName "Marketing Admins" -TargetType Group -PermissionLevel GpoEdit -Replace
  description: |-
    This command sets the permission level for the Marketing Admins security group to GpoEdit on all GPOs in the domain.
    This includes GPOs that are not linked to any site, domain, or OU.
    Because the *Replace* parameter is specified, the new permission level overwrites the existing permissions set for the group.

    This command replaces the current permission level of the Marketing Admins security group with GpoApply for all GPOs on which the group has permissions.
    The command returns each GPO for which the new permission level is set.

    The cmdlet is used to get all the GPOs in the domain.
    Then, the collection is piped into the **ForEach-Object** command.
    As each GPO is evaluated, it is piped into **Get-GPPermission**.
    If a permission level for the Marketing Admins group is returned, the GPO is piped into **Set-GPPermission** to set the permission level for the group.
    The *Replace* parameter is specified to make sure that the previous permission level is overwritten.

    The *ErrorAction* parameter is set to SilentlyContinue for **Get-GPPermissions**.
    This is because a non-terminating error occurs if the specified security principal does not have permissions on the GPO.
    Specifying *ErrorAction* as SilentlyContinue prevents the error messages from being printed for GPOs on which the security principal does not have permissions.
    For more information about the *ErrorAction* parameter, see about_CommonParameters.

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainName
  description: |+
    Specifies the domain for this cmdlet.
    You must specify the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the domain. 

    For the **Set-GPPermission** cmdlet, the GPO for which to get the permission level must exist in this domain. 

    If you do not specify the *DomainName* parameter, the domain of the user that is running the current session is used.
    If the cmdlet is being run from a computer startup or shutdown script, the domain of the computer is used.
    For more information, see the Notes section in the full Help. 

    If you specify a domain that is different from the domain of the user that is running the current session (or, for a startup or shutdown script, the computer), a trust must exist between that domain and the domain of the user or the computer.

    You can also refer to the *DomainName* parameter by its built-in alias, domain.
    For more information, see about_Aliases.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Domain
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Guid" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Guid
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the GPO for which to set the permission level by its globally unique identifier (GUID).

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Server
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the domain controller that this cmdlet contacts to complete the operation.
    You can specify either the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or the host name.

    If you do not specify the name by using the *Server* parameter, the primary domain controller (PDC) emulator is contacted.

    You can also refer to the *Server* parameter by its built-in alias, dc.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: GroupPolicy.Set-GPPermission
name: Set-GPPermission
description: |-
  The **Set-GPPermission** cmdlet grants a level of permissions to a security principal (user, security group, or computer) for one Group Policy Object (GPO) or all the GPOs in a domain.
  You use the *TargetName* and *TargetType* parameters to specify a user, security group, or computer for which to set the permission level.
  You can use the *Name* or the *Guid* parameter to set the permission level for the security principal on a single GPO, or you can use the *All* parameter to set the permission level for the security principal on all GPOs in the domain.

  By default, if the security principal already has a higher permission level than the specified permission level, the change is not applied.
  You can specify the *Replace* parameter, to remove the existing permission level from the GPO before the new permission level is set.
  This ensures that the existing permission level is replaced by the new permission level.
