  code: |-
    PS C:\> Merge-VHD -Path c:\test\Child4.vhdx -DestinationPath c:\test\Child2.vhdx
  description: |-
    This example merges the virtual hard disk from Child4 to Child2, for a virtual disk chain with Child4 as a child of Child3, Child3 as a child of Child2, Child2 as a child of Child1, and Child1 as a child of Parent, and with the virtual hard disk file for each located in c:\test.
    This example merges all data from Child4 and Child3 up to Child2.
    Child4.vhdx and Child3.vhdx are not deleted, but are no longer valid virtual hard disk files after the operation.
