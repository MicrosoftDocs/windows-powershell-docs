  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  name: ComputerName
  description: |+
    Specifies one or more Hyper-V hosts on which the replication statistics of a virtual machine are to be reset.
    NetBIOS names, IP addresses, and fully qualified domain names are allowable.
    The default is the local computer.
    Use localhost or a dot (.) to specify the local computer explicitly.

  defaultValue: None

description: |-
  The **Reset-VMReplicationStatistics** cmdlet resets the replication statistics of a virtual machine.
  Statistics accumulated up to that time are deleted, and replication monitoring begins collecting a new set of statistics.
  If replication health was reported as "Warning", then this operation also changes the health to "Normal".
