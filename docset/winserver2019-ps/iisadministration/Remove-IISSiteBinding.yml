  name: RemoveConfigOnly
  description: |+
    Indicates that this operation does not remove the SSL certificate information and only removes the IIS binding configuration information in the applicationhost.config.

    If you want to delete a HTTPS binding configuration that shares a SSL certificate with other existing bindings, only the IIS binding configuration should be removed so that the SSL certificate information remains.
    This is to ensure that the other existing bindings will still have access to the certificate.

    This parameter is ignored if you are removing a binding which does not have a certificate.
