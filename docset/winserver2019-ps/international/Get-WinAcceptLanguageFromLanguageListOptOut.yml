description: |-
  The **Get-WinAcceptLanguageFromLanguageListOptOut** cmdlet gets the **HTTP Accept Language from Language List opt-out** setting for the current user account.
  By default, the **HTTP Accept Language List** is automatically generated from the language list of the current user account.

  When set to $True, this setting deletes the current content of the **HTTP Accept Language** registry key and prevents changes to the language list from reestablishing the key.
  When set to $False, this setting reestablishes the **HTTP Accept Language List** that is based on the language list for the current user account.
