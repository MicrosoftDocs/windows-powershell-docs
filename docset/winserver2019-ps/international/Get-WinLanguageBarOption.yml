    This cmdlet returns an object that contains the following settings. 

    - **IsLegacyLanguageBar**.
    When this setting is set to true, the desktop language bar is used, where available.
    When this setting is set to false, the modem input switcher is used.
    This is recommended. 
    - **IsLegacySwitchingMode**.
    When this setting is set to true, the current input method, which includes keyboard layout or input method editor (IME), is selected for the current application only.
    When new applications start, the default input method is selected.
    For more information, see the **Get-WinDefaultInputMethodOverride** cmdlet.
    When this setting is set to false, the input method is selected for all applications and changes only when the user actively switches input methods (recommended).
