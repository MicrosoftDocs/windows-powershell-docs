  The **Set-WinHomeLocation** cmdlet sets the value of the user **GeoID** object.
  The Windows GeoID setting is a user setting that describes the home location of the current user account.
  A home location is the country or region.
  Applications that require the home location of the current user account, such as a driver for a television tuner application, can use this setting.

  For a table of GeoIDs, see Table of [Geographical Locations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=242308).
