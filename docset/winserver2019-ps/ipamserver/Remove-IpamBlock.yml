parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 

    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt. 
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes. 
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets. 
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

description: |-
  The **Remove-IpamBlock** cmdlet removes an IP address block from IP Address Management (IPAM).
  Specify an address block by using the *StartIPAddress* and *EndIPAddress* parameters, or use the *InputObject* parameter to specify the input to this cmdlet.
  You can specify the *DeleteAssociatedSubBlocks* parameter to remove all the child IP address ranges mapped to the address block.
  When you remove an address block, IPAM remaps all subnets and unmaps some subnets which it previously mapped to an address block.
