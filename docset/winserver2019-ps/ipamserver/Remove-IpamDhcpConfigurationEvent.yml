  code: |-
    PS C:\> $Today = Get-Date
    PS C:\> Remove-IpamConfigurationEvent -EndDate $Today.AddDays(-1)
  description: |-
    This example removes all configuration events through the previous day.

    The first command creates a **DateTime** object by using the **Get-Date** cmdlet, and then stores it in the $Today variable.
    By default, **Get-Date** creates the current date.
    For more information about **Get-Date** and **DateTime** objects, type `Get-Help Get-Date`.

    The second command removes configuration events from the IPAM database through the previous day.
    The command subtracts one day from the **DateTime** object stored in the $Today variable, and then specifies that value for the *EndDate* parameter.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 

    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt. 
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes. 
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets. 
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  name: EndDate
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the end date as a **DateTime** object.
    The cmdlet removes events through this date from the IPAM database.
    To obtain a **DateTime** object, use the **Get-Date** cmdlet.
    For more information, type `Get-Help Get-Date`.

    Do not specify the current date.

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PassThru
  description: |+
    Returns an object representing the item with which you are working.
    By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

uid: IpamServer.Remove-IpamDhcpConfigurationEvent
name: Remove-IpamDhcpConfigurationEvent
description: |-
  The **Remove-IpamDhcpConfigurationEvent** cmdlet removes configuration events for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) servers from the IP Address Management (IPAM) database.
  The cmdlet permanently deletes configuration events through the specified end date.
  The end date uses the time zone of the IPAM server.

  Use the **Get-IpamDhcpConfigurationEvent** cmdlet to view configuration events from the IPAM database.

  Do not specify the current date as the end date.
  The IPAM server collects the configuration events from DHCP servers as part of the next data gathering task, and, therefore, specifies that the current date does not result in permanent deletion of events from the current day.

  The cmdlet does not delete the configuration events from the DHCP servers themselves.
