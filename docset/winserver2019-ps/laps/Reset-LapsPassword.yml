  The `Reset-LapsPassword` cmdlet tells LAPS to immediately rotate the password for the currently
  managed local account. This operation is performed regardless of the state of the current password,
  for example it doesn't matter whether the current password is considered expired or not.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > This cmdlet is intended and recommended only for rare situations that require an
  > immediate password rotation, for example as a response to a machine security breach situation.
  > Excessively frequent usage of this cmdlet isn't recommended.

  The cmdlet doesn't return detailed information about the results of the operation. See
  [Use Windows LAPS event logs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2234103) for more information
  on querying the resultant event log entries to get specific information on the outcome of the
  operation.
