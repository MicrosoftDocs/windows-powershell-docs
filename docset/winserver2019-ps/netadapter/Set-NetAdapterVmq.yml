  code: |-
    PS C:\> Set-NetAdapterVmq -Name "MyAdapter" -Enabled $True
  description: |-
    This command enables VMQ on the network adapter named MyAdapter.
    The **Enable-NetAdapterVmq** cmdlet is the preferred cmdlet to perform this operation.
  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job.
    Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 
     The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt.
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes.
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets.
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 
     For more information about Windows PowerShell® background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt16" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BaseProcessorGroup
  description: |+
    Specifies the processor group to be used by VMQ.
    Support for systems that have more than 64 logical processors is based on the concept of a processor group, which is a static set of up to 64 logical processors.
    Processor groups are numbered starting with 0.
    Computers with fewer than 64 logical processors always have a single group, Group 0.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: BaseG
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Byte" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BaseProcessorNumber
  description: |+
    Specifies the starting processor to be used within the processor group for VMQ.
    Support for systems that have more than 64  logical processors is based on the concept of a processor group, which is a static set of up to 64  logical processors.
    Processor groups are numbered starting with 0.
    Computers with fewer than 64 logical processors always have a single group, Group 0.
    A logical processor is identified by a group number, using the *BaseProcessorGroup* parameter, and a group-relative processor number, using this parameter.

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="CimSession" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Enabled
  description: |+

    The acceptable values for this parameter are: $True or $False.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IncludeHidden
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet includes both visible and hidden network adapters in the operation.
    By default only visible network adapters are included.
    If a wildcard character is used in identifying a network adapter and this parameter has been specified, then the wildcard string is matched against both hidden and visible network adapters.

  defaultValue: None

  name: InterfaceDescription
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of network adapter interface descriptions.
    For a physical network adapter this is typically the name of the vendor of the network adapter followed by a part number and description, such as `Contoso 12345 Gigabit Network Device`.

  defaultValue: None

  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

uid: NetAdapter.Set-NetAdapterVmq
name: Set-NetAdapterVmq
description: |-
  The **Set-NetAdapterVmq** cmdlet sets the virtual machine queue (VMQ) properties of a network adapter.
  VMQ is a scaling networking technology for Hyper-V switch that improves network throughput by distributing processing of network traffic for multiple virtual machines among multiple processors.
  A thorough familiarity with VMQ and dynamic VMQ is highly recommended before changing any default values with this cmdlet.
