  name: DisplayGroup
  description: |+
    Specifies that only matching firewall rules of the indicated group association are disabled.
    Wildcard characters are accepted. 
    The *Group* parameter specifies the source string for this parameter.
    If the value for this parameter is a localizable string, then the *Group* parameter contains an indirect string.
    Rule groups can be used to organize rules by influence and allows batch rule modifications.
    Using the Set-NetFirewallRule cmdlet, if the group name is specified for a set of rules or sets, then all of the rules or sets in that group receive the same set of modifications.
    It is a good practice to specify the *Group* parameter value with a universal and world-ready indirect @FirewallAPI name. 
    This parameter cannot be specified upon object creation using the New-NetFirewallRule cmdlet, but can be modified using dot-notation and the Set-NetFirewallRule cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None

  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies that only matching firewall rules of the indicated display name are disabled.
    Wildcard characters are accepted. 
    Specifies the localized, user-facing name of the firewall rule being created.
    When creating a rule this parameter is required.
    This parameter value is locale-dependent.
    If the object is not modified, this parameter value may change in certain circumstances.
    When writing scripts in multi-lingual environments, the *Name* parameter should be used instead, where the default value is a randomly assigned value.
    This parameter cannot be set to All.

- type: <xref href="EdgeTraversal" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: EdgeTraversalPolicy
  description: |+
    Specifies that matching firewall rules of the indicated edge traversal policy are disabled. 
    This parameter specifies how this firewall rule will handle edge traversal cases. 
    The acceptable values for this parameter are: Block, Allow, DeferToUser, or DeferToApp 

    - Block: Prevents applications from receiving unsolicited traffic from the Internet through a NAT edge device. 
    - Allow: Allows applications to receive unsolicited traffic directly from the Internet through a NAT edge device. 
    - DeferToUser: Allows the user to decide whether to allow unsolicited traffic from the Internet through a NAT edge device when an application requests it. 
    - DeferToApp: Allows each application to determine whether to allow unsolicited traffic from the Internet through a NAT edge device. 
    The default value is Block. 
    The DeferToApp and DeferToUser options are only valid for computers running firstref_client_7, firstref_server_7, and Windows Server® 2012.

  defaultValue: None

  description: |+
    Specifies that matching firewall rules of the indicated state are disabled. 
    This parameter specifies that the rule object is administratively enabled or administratively disabled.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:
    - True: Specifies the rule is currently enabled. 
    - False: Specifies the rule is currently disabled.
    A disabled rule will not actively modify system behavior, but the management construct still exists on the computer so it can be re-enabled.

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: GPOSession
  description: |+
    Specifies the network GPO from which to retrieve the rules to be disabled. 
    This parameter is used in the same way as the *PolicyStore* parameter.
    When modifying GPOs in Windows PowerShell®, each change to a GPO requires the entire GPO to be loaded, modified, and saved back.
    On a busy Domain Controller (DC), this can be a slow and resource-heavy operation.
    A GPO Session loads a domain GPO onto the local computer and makes all changes in a batch, before saving it back.
    This reduces the load on the DC and speeds up the Windows PowerShell cmdlets.
    To load a GPO Session, use the Open-NetGPO cmdlet.
    To save a GPO Session, use the Save-NetGPO cmdlet.

  name: Group
  description: |+
    Specifies that only matching firewall rules of the indicated group association are disabled.
    Wildcard characters are accepted. 
    This parameter specifies the source string for the *DisplayGroup* parameter.
    If the *DisplayGroup* parameter value is a localizable string, then this parameter contains an indirect string.
    Rule groups can be used to organize rules by influence and allows batch rule modifications.
    Using the Set-NetFirewallRule cmdlets, if the group name is specified for a set of rules or sets, then all of the rules or sets in that group receive the same set of modifications.
    It is good practice to specify this parameter value with a universal and world-ready indirect @FirewallAPI name. 
    The *DisplayGroup* parameter cannot be specified upon object creation using the New-NetFirewallRule cmdlet, but can be modified using dot-notation and the Set-NetFirewallRule cmdlet.

  name: LocalOnlyMapping
  description: |+
    Indicates that matching firewall rules of the indicated value are disabled. 
    This parameter specifies the firewall rules for local only mapping, which describes whether a packet must pass through a local address on the way to the destination. 
    Non-TCP traffic is session-less.
    Windows Firewall authorizes traffic per session, not per packet, for performance reasons.
    Generally, non-TCP sessions are inferred by checking the following fields: local address, remote address, protocol, local port, and remote port. 
    If this parameter is set to True, then the remote address and port will be ignored when inferring remote sessions.
    Sessions will be grouped based on local address, protocol, and local port. 
    This is similar to the *LooseSourceMapping* parameter, but performs better in cases where the traffic does not need to be filtered by remote address.
    This could improve performance on heavy server workloads where UDP requests come from dynamic client ports.
    For instance, Teredo relay servers.

  defaultValue: None

  name: LooseSourceMapping
  description: |+
    Indicates that matching firewall rules of the indicated value are disabled. 
    This parameter specifies the firewall rules for loose source mapping, which describes whether a packet can have a non-local source address when being forwarded to a destination. 
    If this parameter is set to True, then the rule accepts packets incoming from a host other than the one the packets were sent to.
    This parameter applies only to UDP protocol traffic. 
    The default value is False.

  defaultValue: None

  aliases: LSM
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies that only matching firewall rules of the indicated name are disabled.
    Wildcard characters are accepted. 
    This parameter acts just like a filename, in that only one rule with a given name may exist in a policy store at a time.
    During group policy processing and policy merge, rules that have the same name but come from multiple stores being merged, will overwrite one another so that only one exists.
    This overwriting behavior is desirable if the rules serve the same purpose.
    For instance, all of the firewall rules have specific names, so if an administrator can copy these rules to a GPO, and the rules will override the local versions on a local computer.
    GPOs can have precedence.
    So if an administrator has a different or more specific rule with the same name in a higher-precedence GPO, then it overrides other rules that exist. 
    The default value is a randomly assigned value. 
    When the defaults for main mode encryption need to overridden, specify the customized parameters and set this parameter, making it the new default setting for encryption.

  name: Owner
  description: |+
    Specifies that matching firewall rules of the indicated owner are disabled. 
    This parameter specifies the owner of the firewall rule, represented as an SDDL string.
    All Windows Store applications that require network traffic create network isolation rules (normally through installing via the Store), where the user that installed the application is the owner.
    This parameter specifies that only network packets that are authenticated as coming from or going to an owner identified in the list of accounts (SID) match this rule.

  name: PolicyStore
  description: |+
    Specifies the policy store from which to retrieve the rules to be disabled . 
    A policy store is a container for firewall and IPsec policy. 
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - PersistentStore: Sometimes called static rules, this store contains the persistent policy for the local computer.
    This policy is not from GPOs, and has been created manually or programmatically (during application installation) on the computer.
    Rules created in this store are attached to the ActiveStore and activated on the system immediately. 
    - ActiveStore: This store contains the currently active policy, which is the sum of all policy stores that apply to the computer.
    This is the resultant set of policy (RSOP) for the local computer (the sum of all GPOs that apply to the computer), and the local stores (the PersistentStore, the static Windows service hardening (WSH), and the configurable WSH).
    ---- GPOs are also policy stores.
    Computer GPOs can be specified as follows. 
    ------ `-PolicyStore hostnamehostname`. 
    ---- Active Directory GPOs can be specified as follows. 
    ------ `-PolicyStore domain.fqdn.com\GPO_Friendly_Namedomain.fqdn.comGPO_Friendly_Name`. 
    ------ Such as the following. 
    -------- `-PolicyStore localhost`
    -------- `-PolicyStore corp.contoso.com\FirewallPolicy`
    ---- Active Directory GPOs can be created using the **New-GPO** cmdlet or the Group Policy Management Console.
    - RSOP: This read-only store contains the sum of all GPOs applied to the local computer. 
    - SystemDefaults: This read-only store contains the default state of firewall rules that ship with Windows Server® 2012. 
    - StaticServiceStore: This read-only store contains all the service restrictions that ship with Windows.
    Optional and product-dependent features are considered part of Windows Server 2012 for the purposes of WFAS. 
    - ConfigurableServiceStore: This read-write store contains all the service restrictions that are added for third-party services.
    In addition, network isolation rules that are created for Windows Store application containers will appear in this policy store. 

    The default value is PersistentStore. 
    The Set-NetFirewallRule cmdlet cannot be used to add an object to a policy store.
    An object can only be added to a policy store at creation time with this cmdlet or the New-NetFirewallRule cmdlet.

  name: PolicyStoreSource
  description: |+
    Specifies that firewall rules matching the indicated policy store source are disabled. 
    This parameter contains a path to the policy store where the rule originated if the object is retrieved from the ActiveStore with the TracePolicyStoreSource option set.
    This parameter value is automatically generated and should not be modified. 
    The monitoring output from this parameter is not completely compatible with the **PolicyStore** parameter.
    This parameter value cannot always be passed into the **PolicyStore** parameter.
    Domain GPOs are one example in which this parameter contains only the GPO name, not the domain name.

  name: PolicyStoreSourceType
  description: |+
    Specifies that firewall rules that match the indicated policy store source type are disabled. 
    This parameter describes the type of policy store where the rule originated if the object is retrieved from the ActiveStore with the TracePolicyStoreSource option set.
    This parameter value is automatically generated and should not be modified. 
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Local: The object originates from the local store. 
    - GroupPolicy: The object originates from a GPO. 
    - Dynamic: The object originates from the local runtime state.
    This policy store name is not valid for use in cmdlets, but may appear when monitoring active policy. 
    - Generated: The object was generated automatically.
    This policy store name is not valid for use in cmdlets, but may appear when monitoring active policy. 
    - Hardcoded: The object was hard-coded.
    This policy store name is not valid for use in cmdlets, but may appear when monitoring active policy.

- type: <xref href="PrimaryStatus" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: PrimaryStatus
  description: |+
    Specifies that firewall rules that match the indicated primary status are disabled. 
    This parameter specifies the overall status of the rule. 

    - OK: Specifies that the rule will work as specified. 
    - Degraded: Specifies that one or more parts of the rule will not be enforced. 
    - Error: Specifies that the computer is unable to use the rule at all. 

    See the Status and StatusCode fields of the object for more detailed status information.

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Status
  description: |+
    Specifies that firewall rules that match the indicated status are disabled. 
    This parameter describes the status message for the specified status code value.
    The status code is a numerical value that indicates any syntax, parsing, or runtime errors in the rule or set.
    This parameter value should not be modified.

  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  name: TracePolicyStore
  description: |+
    Indicates that the firewall rules that match the indicated policy store are disabled. 
    This parameter specifies that the name of the source GPO is set to the *PolicyStoreSource* parameter value.

  IMPORTANT NOTE: Running this cmdlet without parameters disables all Windows Firewall rules on the target computer.
  Always run this cmdlet with the *WhatIf* parameter if you are not targeting a specific Windows Firewall rule or group of rules.

  The **Disable-NetFirewallRule** cmdlet disables a previously enabled firewall rule to be inactive within the computer or a group policy organizational unit.
  A Disabled rule will not actively modify system behavior, but the rule still exists on the computer or in a Group Policy Object (GPO) so it can be re-enabled.
  This is different from the Remove-NetFirewallRule cmdlet, which permanently removes the rule.

  This cmdlet gets one or more firewall rules to be disabled with the *Name* parameter (default), the *DisplayName* parameter, rule properties, or by the associated filters or objects.
  The *Enabled* parameter value for the resulting queried rules is set to False.

  Disabling IPsec and firewall rules can be useful for debugging firewall policy mismatch issues, but is easier when the rules are in the local, or persistent, store.
  Disabling rules in a GPO container will not take effect until the next time the client applies the GPO.
  To troubleshoot GPO-based firewall policy, consider copying all the rules and authorization and cryptographic sets from the GPO to a computer that does not have the GPO policy applied using the Copy-NetFirewallRule cmdlet.
  This is way to locally modify the policy, in order to troubleshoot any IPsec problems.
