  name: DisplayName
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the display name to match the differences in IP addresses of the IPsec rule.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "2"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: DnsServers
  description: |+
    Specifies a list of DNS server IP addresses that will be used for name resolution used to determine IP address differences.
    This parameter accepts one or more DNS server IP addresses.
    If this parameter is not specified, then this cmdlet uses the default DNS servers.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "6"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Domains
  description: |+
    Specifies the domains from which the deltas in IP addresses are derived.
    The list is specified by an array of fully qualified domain names (FQDN).

  defaultValue: None
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: EndpointType
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies that the local or remote endpoint should be modified by adding or removing the IP address differences.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are: Endpoint1 or Endpoint2.
    Endpoint1 corresponds to the local address and Endpoint2 corresponds to the remote address for any IPsec rule.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "5"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PolicyStore
  description: |+
    Specifies the policy store from which to retrieve the rules to be retrieved. 
    A policy store is a container for firewall and IPsec policy. 
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - PersistentStore: Sometimes called static rules, this store contains the persistent policy for the local computer.
    This policy is not from GPOs, and has been created manually or programmatically (during application installation) on the computer.
    Rules created in this store are attached to the ActiveStore and activated on the computer immediately. 
    - ActiveStore: This store contains the currently active policy, which is the sum of all policy stores that apply to the computer.
    This is the resultant set of policy (RSOP) for the local computer (the sum of all GPOs that apply to the computer), and the local stores (the PersistentStore, the static Windows service hardening (WSH), and the configurable WSH). 
    ---- GPOs are also policy stores.
    Computer GPOs can be specified as follows. 
    ------ `-PolicyStore hostname`. 
    ---- Active Directory GPOs can be specified as follows. 
    ------ `-PolicyStore domain.fqdn.com\GPO_Friendly_Namedomain.fqdn.comGPO_Friendly_Name`. 
    ------ Such as the following. 
    -------- `-PolicyStore localhost`
    -------- `-PolicyStore corp.contoso.com\FirewallPolicy`
    ---- Active Directory GPOs can be created using the **New-GPO** cmdlet or the Group Policy Management Console. 
    - RSOP: This read-only store contains the sum of all GPOs applied to the local computer. 
    - SystemDefaults: This read-only store contains the default state of firewall rules that ship with Windows Server® 2012. 
    - StaticServiceStore: This read-only store contains all the service restrictions that ship with Windows.
    Optional and product-dependent features are considered part of Windows Server 2012 for the purposes of WFAS. 
    - ConfigurableServiceStore: This read-write store contains all the service restrictions that are added for third-party services.
    In addition, network isolation rules that are created for Windows Store application containers will appear in this policy store. 
    The default value is PersistentStore. 
    The Set-NetIPsecRule cmdlet cannot be used to add an object to a policy store.
    An object can only be added to a policy store at creation time with the Copy-NetIPsecRule cmdlet or with the New-NetIPsecRule cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "3"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PSLocation
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the path for the newly created Windows PowerShell script (`.ps1`) file.
    This parameter supports standard Windows PowerShell path syntax.
    This parameter must contain a rooted path, such as `C:\users\User1\WPS_Script.ps1`.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "4"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Servers
  description: |+
    Specifies a list of server IP addresses that will be used to derive IP address differences.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: NetSecurity.Get-DAPolicyChange
name: Get-DAPolicyChange
description: |-
  The **Get-DAPolicyChange** cmdlet returns the detected differences between the IP addresses (remote and local addresses) of an existing IPsec rule, and the IP addresses derived by the input parameters.
  This cmdlet also creates a Windows PowerShell® script (`.ps1`) that updates the IPsec rule end points with the retrieved IP addresses.
  The created script contains instances of the Update-NetIPsecRule cmdlet, that adds or deletes IP addresses to or from IPsec rules.

  This cmdlet is used to keep the IPsec policies for client and server refreshed in DirectAccess (DA) deployments in a double tunnel model.
  The DA first tunnel policy is defined by IP addresses that are derived from domain names and servers.
  A list of IP addresses is retrieved based on the derived values from the *Domains* or *Servers* parameter.
  This cmdlet outputs *DeltaCollection* objects that contain the following: the actual list of address changes detected, whether to add or delete the change in IP addresses, and a list of fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) that did not resolve.
  If there are multiple rules that match the same name, then this cmdlet fails with an error.

  Running the output script for this cmdlet (located at PSLocation) resolves the IP addresses for the DA first tunnel and updates the Group Policy Objects (GPOs) appropriately.
  The DNS server specified in the *DnsServers* parameter will be used to resolve the domain name and server names.

  By generating a Windows PowerShell script, this cmdlet allows administrators to have greater control over policy synchronization.
  The Sync-NetIPsecRule cmdlet also detects the IP address changes, but immediately updates the rules instead of returning the deviations and a `.ps1` script.
