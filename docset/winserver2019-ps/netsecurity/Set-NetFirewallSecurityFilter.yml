parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Authentication" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Authentication
  description: |+
    Specifies that authentication is required on firewall rules. 
    The acceptable values for this parameter are: NotRequired, Required, or NoEncap. 

    - NotRequired: Any network packet matches this rule, that it is protected by IPsec.
    This option is the equivalent of not selecting the allow only secure connections option in the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security MMC snap-in. 
    - Required: Network packets that are authenticated by IPsec match this rule.
    A separate IPsec rule must be created to authenticate the traffic.
    This option is the equivalent of the allow only secure connections option in the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security MMC snap-in. 
    - NoEncap: Network connections that are authenticated, but not encapsulated by Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) or Authentication Header (AH) match this rule.
    This option is useful for connections that must be monitored by network equipment, such as intrusion detection systems (IDS), that are not compatible with ESP NULL-protected network packets.
    The initial connection is authenticated by IPsec by using AuthIP, but the quick mode SA permits clear-text traffic.
    To use this option, you must also configure an IPsec rule that specifies authentication with encapsulation none as a quick mode security method.
    In the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), authentication and encryption are combined into one set of radio buttons.
    In Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) or Windows PowerShell®, authentication and encryption are given as two separate options. 

    The default value is Required. 
    A rule can be queried for this condition, or modified by using the security filter object.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: NotRequired, Required, NoEncap
- type: <xref href="CimSession" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Encryption" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Encryption
  description: |+
    Specifies that encryption in authentication is required on firewall rules.
    The authentication is done through a separate IPsec or main mode rule. 
    The acceptable values for this parameter are: NotRequired, Required, or Dynamic. 

    - NotRequired: Encryption is not required for authentication. 
    - Required: Encryption is required for authentication through an IPsec rule. 
    - Dynamic: This is `authdynenc` in the netsh command-line. 

    The default value is NotRequired. 
    A rule can be queried for this condition, or modified by using the security filter object.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: NotRequired, Required, Dynamic
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: GPOSession
  description: |+
    Targets the network GPO from which to retrieve the rules to be modified. 
    This parameter is used in the same way as the *PolicyStore* parameter.
    When modifying GPOs in Windows PowerShell®, each change to a GPO requires the entire GPO to be loaded, modified, and saved back.
    On a busy Domain Controller (DC), this can be a slow and resource-heavy operation.
    A GPO Session loads a domain GPO onto the local computer and makes all changes in a batch, before saving it back.
    This reduces the load on the DC and speeds up the Windows PowerShell cmdlets.
    To load a GPO Session, use the Open-NetGPO cmdlet.
    To save a GPO Session, use the Save-NetGPO cmdlet.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: LocalUser
  description: |+
    Specifies the principals to which the network traffic this firewall rule should apply.
    This is an SDDL string.
    The principals, represented by SIDs in the SDDL string, can be services, users, application containers, or any other SID that network traffic could be associated with.
    This parameter specifies that only network packets that are authenticated as coming from or going to a principal identified in the list of accounts (SID) match this rule. 
    Querying for rules with this parameter can only be performed using filter objects.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: OverrideBlockRules
  description: |+
    Allows matching network traffic that would otherwise be modified.
    The network traffic must be authenticated by using a separate IPsec rule. 
    If the *Direction* parameter is set to Inbound, then this parameter is valid only for rules that have one or more accounts listed in the *RemoteUser* parameter and optionally the *RemoteMachine* parameter.
    Network packets that match this rule and that are successfully authenticated against a computer account specified in the *RemoteUser* parameter and against a user account identified in the *RemoteMachine* parameter are permitted through the firewall. 
    If this parameter is specified, then the *Authentication* parameter cannot be set to *NotRequired*.
    This parameter is equivalent to the override block rules checkbox in the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security MMC snap-in. 
    For computers that are running Windows® 7 or nextref_server_7, this parameter is permitted on an outbound rule.
    Selecting this parameter on an outbound rule causes matching traffic to be permitted through this rule even if other matching rules would block the traffic.
    No accounts are required in the *RemoteMachine* or *RemoteUser* parameter for an outbound bypass rule, however, if authorized or excepted computers are listed in those groups the rules will be enforced. 
    This parameter is not valid on outbound rules on computers that are running firstref_vista or earlier. 
    Querying for rules with this parameter can only be performed using filter objects.
    See the Get-NetFirewallSecurityFilter cmdlet for more information.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PassThru
  description: |+
    Returns an object representing the item with which you are working.
    By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PolicyStore
  description: |+
    Targets the policy store from which to retrieve the rules to be modified. 
    A policy store is a container for firewall and IPsec policy. 
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - PersistentStore: Sometimes called static rules, this store contains the persistent policy for the local computer.
    This policy is not from GPOs, and has been created manually or programmatically (during application installation) on the computer.
    Rules created in this store are attached to the ActiveStore and activated on the computer immediately. 
    - ActiveStore: This store contains the currently active policy, which is the sum of all policy stores that apply to the computer.
    This is the resultant set of policy (RSOP) for the local computer (the sum of all GPOs that apply to the computer), and the local stores (the PersistentStore, the static Windows service hardening (WSH), and the configurable WSH). 
    ---- GPOs are also policy stores.
    Computer GPOs can be specified as follows. 
    ------ `-PolicyStore hostname`. 
    ---- Active Directory GPOs can be specified as follows. 
    ------ `-PolicyStore domain.fqdn.com\GPO_Friendly_Namedomain.fqdn.comGPO_Friendly_Name`. 
    ------ Such as the following. 
    -------- `-PolicyStore localhost`
    -------- `-PolicyStore corp.contoso.com\FirewallPolicy`
    ---- Active Directory GPOs can be created using the **New-GPO** cmdlet or the Group Policy Management Console. 
    - RSOP: This read-only store contains the sum of all GPOs applied to the local computer. 
    - SystemDefaults: This read-only store contains the default state of firewall rules that ship with Windows Server® 2012. 
    - StaticServiceStore: This read-only store contains all the service restrictions that ship with Windows Server 2012.
    Optional and product-dependent features are considered part of Windows Server 2012 for the purposes of WFAS. 
    - ConfigurableServiceStore: This read-write store contains all the service restrictions that are added for third-party services.
    In addition, network isolation rules that are created for Windows Store application containers will appear in this policy store. 
    The default value is PersistentStore. 
    The Set-NetFirewallRule cmdlet cannot be used to add an object to a policy store.
    An object can only be added to a policy store at creation time with the Copy-NetFirewallRule cmdlet or with the New-NetFirewallRule cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RemoteMachine
  description: |+
    Specifies that matching IPsec rules of the indicated computer accounts are modified.
    This parameter specifies that only network packets that are authenticated as incoming from or outgoing to a computer identified in the list of computer accounts (SID) match this rule.
    This parameter value is specified as an SDDL string. 
    Querying for rules with this parameter can only be performed using filter objects.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RemoteUser
  description: |+
    Specifies that matching IPsec rules of the indicated user accounts are modified.
    This parameter specifies that only network packets that are authenticated as incoming from or outgoing to a user identified in the list of user accounts (SID) match this rule.
    This parameter value is specified as an SDDL string. 
    Querying for rules with this parameter can only be performed using filter objects.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf

  The **Set-NetFirewallSecurityFilter** cmdlet modifies the security conditions associated with the input firewall rules.

  See the Get-NetFirewallSecurityFilter cmdlet for more information on the security filters.

  To modify the security conditions, two methods can be used starting with the security filters returned by the Get-NetFirewallSecurityFilter cmdlet and optional additional querying. 

  - The network firewall security filter objects can be piped into the Get-NetFirewallRule cmdlet.
  The Get-NetFirewallRule cmdlet returns the rules associated with the filters and pipes the rules into the Set-NetFirewallRule cmdlet, which configures the interface properties. 
  - Alternatively, piping the network firewall security filter objects directly to this cmdlet modifies the *Authentication*, *Encryption*, *OverrideBlockRules*, *LocalUser*, *RemoteUser*, and *RemoteMachine* parameters of the rules.
