  code: |-
    PS C:\>Set-NetNeighbor -InterfaceIndex 12 -IPAddress "192.168.0.5" -LinkLayerAddress "00-00-12-00-00-ff"

- title: 'Example 2: Set the link-layer address for a neighbor cache entry by using an input object'
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Get-NetNeighbor -InterfaceIndex 12 -IPAddress "192.168.0.5" | Set-NetNeighbor -LinkLayerAddress "00-00-12-00-00-ff"
  description: |-
    This command gets the **NetNeighbor** object that has the IP address 192.168.0.5 and the interface index value of 12.
    The command passes the object to the **Set-NetNeighbor** cmdlet by using the pipeline operator.
    **Set-NetNeighbor** sets the link-layer address for the neighbor cache entry to 00-00-12-00-00-ff.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="AddressFamily" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: AddressFamily
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of IP address families.
    The cmdlet modifies the neighbor cache entries that belong to the IP address families you specify.
    If you do not specify this parameter, the cmdlet automatically generates the address families of the neighbor cache entries.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - IPv4
    - IPv6

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: IPv4, IPv6
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimSession" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IncludeAllCompartments
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet includes neighbor cache entries from all configured network compartments.
    If you do not specify this parameter, the cmdlet modifies only neighbor cache entries in the default network compartment.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimInstance" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: InputObject
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the input object that is used in a pipeline command.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: InterfaceAlias
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of aliases of network interfaces.
    The cmdlet modifies neighbor cache entries for the network interfaces that have the aliases you specify.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ifAlias
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: InterfaceIndex
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of indexes of network interfaces.
    The cmdlet modifies neighbor cache entries for the network interfaces located at the indexes you specify.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ifIndex
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: IPAddress
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of IP addresses.
    The cmdlet modifies neighbor cache entries that have the IP addresses you specify.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: LinkLayerAddress
  description: |+
    Specifies the link-layer address of the neighbor cache entry.
    The cmdlet modifies the link-layer address of the neighbor cache entry you specify.

    The link-layer address is also called the media access control (MAC) address.
    A link-layer address that uses IPv4 address syntax is a tunnel technology that encapsulates packets over an IPv4 tunnel, such as Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) or Teredo.
    A link-layer address of all zeroes indicates that the neighbor is unreachable and the neighbor cache entry does not have a link-layer address entry.
    An empty link-layer address indicates that the link layer does not use link-layer addresses, such as on a loopback interface.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PassThru
  description: |+
    Returns an object representing the item with which you are working.
    By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PolicyStore
  description: |+
    Specifies a **PolicyStore** value.
    The cmdlet modifies the **PolicyStore** setting for the neighbor cache entry to the value you specify.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - ActiveStore: The IP address information is valid. 
    - PersistentStore: The computer saves IP address information across restarts.
    When the computer restarts, it copies the saved settings to the ActiveStore. 

    Specify ActiveStore only.

    If you do not specify this parameter, the default entries are created in both the ActiveStore and the PersistentStore.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="State" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: State
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of states of the neighbor cache entry.
    The cmdlet modifies the neighbor cache entries that have the states you specify.
    You can modify only neighbor cache entries that are in a permanent state.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Permanent.
    The neighbor is statically provisioned and will not expire unless you remove it.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Unreachable, Incomplete, Probe, Delay, Stale, Reachable, Permanent
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: wi
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: NetTCPIP.Set-NetNeighbor
name: Set-NetNeighbor
description: |-
  The **Set-NetNeighbor** cmdlet modifies a neighbor cache entry.
  The neighbor cache maintains information for each on-link neighbor, including the IP address and the associated link-layer address.
  You can modify only neighbor cache entries that are in a permanent state on interfaces that have link-layer addresses.
  Use this cmdlet to modify the link-layer address and policy store setting of a neighbor cache entry.
