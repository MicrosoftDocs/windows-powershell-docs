  This cmdlet retrieves the configuration of a load balancer resource. The load balancer resource allows fine-grained configuration of how incoming traffic is distributed across VM instances in a virtual network. It contains the following:
  1. Front End IP configuration - This describes the exposed IP address of the load balancer. For example, this address can be a reserved public or private IP address previously obtained by the customer, or an IP address dynamically allocated from a subnet of a virtual network.
  2. BackEnd address pools - This describes the backend VMs behind the front end IP resource.
  3. Load balancing rules - This defines how traffic that arrives at the front-end IP is to be sent to the backend IP
  4. Health probe - Health probes are used by the load balancer to determine the health state of the backend pool members.
  5. Inbound NAT rules - This can be used to forward external traffic to a specific VM in the virtual network
  6. Outbound NAT rules - This can be used to forward VM network traffic from the virtual network to external destinations using network address translation (NAT).
