  name: CertificateThumbPrint
  description: |+
    Specifies the digital public key X.509 certificate of a user account that has permission to perform this action.
    This is the certificate thumbprint of the certificate.
    This thumbprint must also be provided in the ClientCertificateThumbprint parameter in the Install-NetworkController or Set-NetworkController cmdlet so that Network Controller can authorize this user.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Uri" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ConnectionUri
  isRequired: true

description: |-
  This cmdlet creates a new route table in the Network Controller.
  If you want to route traffic to virtual appliances in your environment, you can specify routes and associate them to a virtual subnet.
  Subnets rely on system routes until a route table is associated to the subnet.
  After an association exists, routing is done based on Longest Prefix Match (LPM) among both user defined routes and system routes. 
  If there is more than one route with the same LPM match, then the user defined route is selected first - before the system route.
