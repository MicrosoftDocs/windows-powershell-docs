  The **Remove-NetworkControllerNode** cmdlet removes a node from the existing set of nodes in a network controller deployment.
  You can use this cmdlet to scale down a cluster in the case that it has more capacity than is needed for operations.
  You cannot scale down from a three node deployment.
  If you want to move to a single node deployment from a three node deployment, you must unconfigure the cluster and configure it again with a single node.
