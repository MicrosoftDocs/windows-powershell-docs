  The **Repair-NetworkControllerCluster** cmdlet is used in a scenario when a majority of nodes in the network controller deployment become unavailable, thus causing quorum loss for the deployment

  As quorum is lost, the remaining nodes lose consistency and up-to-date data.
  When a quorum loss occurs, the network controller will stop functioning.
  If you have deployed System Center Operations Manager for network controller monitoring, you will be able to see a red alert on the Operations Manager console.
  If you are not using Operations Manager, you will see critical events in the network controller event channels on the nodes that describe the problem.
  When this happens, you must bring the unreachable nodes up or add additional nodes to the deployment so that quorum can be restored.
  After this, you have to run this cmdlet so that the network controller can internally do a consistency check on the data and state inside the controller system.
  After the consistency check is complete, the network controller will enable its services and start working.
