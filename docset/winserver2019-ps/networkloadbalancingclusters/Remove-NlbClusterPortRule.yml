description: |-
  The **Remove-NlbClusterPortRule** cmdlet removes a port rule from a Network Load Balancing (NLB) cluster.
  Port rules control how an NLB cluster functions.
  To maximize the control of various types of TCP/IP traffic, port rules can be set up to control how each port's cluster-network traffic is handled.
  The number and type of port rules must be exactly the same for each node in the cluster.
  If a node attempts to join the cluster with a different number of rules or with different rules from the other nodes, then it is not accepted as part of the cluster.

  This cmdlet changes the configuration on all cluster nodes.
  As a result, the NLB cluster will have to restart the convergence process on all nodes to guarantee that configuration changes have been applied on all nodes and that a consistent state is reached.
  Any additional operations on the NLB cluster should not be initiated until all cluster nodes have completed the convergence process and are back to the converged state.
