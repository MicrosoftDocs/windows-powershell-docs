parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Indicates that this cmdlet runs the command as a background job on a remote computer.
    Use this parameter to run commands that take an extensive time to finish.

    When you use the *AsJob* parameter, the command returns an object that represents the job, and then displays the command prompt.
    You can continue to work in the session while the job finishes.
    To manage the job, use the **Job** cmdlets.
    To get the job results, use the Receive-Job cmdlet.

    The *AsJob* parameter resembles using the Invoke-Command cmdlet to run a Start-Job command remotely.
    However, with *AsJob*, the job is created on the local computer, even though the job runs on a remote computer, and the results of the remote job are automatically returned to the local computer.

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251) and [about_Remote_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135184).

  defaultValue: None

  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ComputerName
  description: |+
    Specifies the host name of a computer that holds a lock to files on the NFS server.
    All the locks that the specified computer holds are enumerated.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "2"
  aliases: client, name, ClientComputer
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ClientLockType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: LockType
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of lock types.
    **Get-NfsClientLock** gets files that have the specified lock types.
    Valid values are NLM and NFS.

    Locks acquired by NFS clients that mount files to an NFS share by using the NFS v2 or the NFS v3 protocol are Network Lock Manager (NLM) locks.
    Locks acquired by NFS clients that mount files by using the NFS v4.1 protocol are NFS locks.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: type
  parameterValueGroup: NLM, NFS
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Path
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of paths and file names on the NFS server.
    **Get-NfsClientLock** gets the locked files on an NFS server that have the specified paths.
    If there are multiple clients that have multiple locks on the same file, all the locks are revoked.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: LockedFile, file
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: StateId
  description: |+
    Specifies the state identifier of the locks on the NFS server.
    *StateId* applies only to locks that an NFS client acquires by using the NFS v4.1 protocol.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "2"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: NFS.Get-NfsClientLock
name: Get-NfsClientLock
description: |-
  The **Get-NfsClientLock** cmdlet gets locks that client computers hold for files that a Network File System (NFS) server shares.

  For NFS v3 protocol locks, this cmdlet gets NFS client locks based on the list of client computers that hold locks to a particular file, and the list of files that a particular client computer has locked.

  For NFS v4 protocol locks, this cmdlet gets NFS client locks based on the list of files that a particular client computer has locked, and the state identifiers of the locked files.

  You can also use the *LockType* parameter to get locked files on an NFS server based on the NFS protocol that the NFS client uses.
