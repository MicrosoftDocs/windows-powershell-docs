parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Indicates that this cmdlet runs the command as a background job on a remote computer.
    Use this parameter to run commands that take an extensive time to finish.

    When you use the *AsJob* parameter, the command returns an object that represents the job, and then displays the command prompt.
    You can continue to work in the session while the job finishes.
    To manage the job, use the **Job** cmdlets.
    To get the job results, use the Receive-Job cmdlet.

    The *AsJob* parameter resembles using the Invoke-Command cmdlet to run a Start-Job command remotely.
    However, with *AsJob*, the job is created on the local computer, even though the job runs on a remote computer, and the results of the remote job are automatically returned to the local computer.

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251) and [about_Remote_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135184).

  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: ClientGroupName

    Specifies an array of client group names.

  name: ExcludeName
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of client group names to exclude from the client groups that the cmdlet gets from the NFS server.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: LiteralName
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of client groups to get from the NFS server.

    The cmdlet uses the value of *LiteralName* exactly as typed.
    The cmdlet does not interpret any characters as wildcards.
    If the name includes escape characters, enclose it in single quotation marks (').
    Single quotation marks instruct Windows PowerShell not to interpret any characters as escape sequences.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None

uid: NFS.Get-NfsClientgroup
name: Get-NfsClientgroup
description: |-
  The **Get-NfsClientGroup** cmdlet gets a list of client groups configured on a Network File System (NFS) server and the list of members of the client groups.
  By default, the cmdlet enumerates all the client groups configured on a server.
  You can use the optional **ClientGroupName** parameter to get a specific client group.
