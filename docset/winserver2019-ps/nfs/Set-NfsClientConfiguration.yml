    PS C:\> Set-NfsClientConfig -DefaultAccessMode 755 -ReadBufferSize 64 -WriteBufferSize 64
  description: |-
    This command modifies configuration settings for an NFS client on the local computer.
    This command sets the default permissions for newly created files to 755, and it sets the sizes of the read and write buffers to 64 kilobytes (KB).

    The default permission of 755 sets read, write, and execute permissions (7 - rwx) for the owner, read and execute permissions (5 -- r-x) for the group, and read and execute permissions (5 -- r-x) for others.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Indicates that this cmdlet runs the command as a background job on a remote computer.
    Use this parameter to run commands that take an extensive time to finish.

    When you use the *AsJob* parameter, the command returns an object that represents the job, and then displays the command prompt.
    You can continue to work in the session while the job finishes.
    To manage the job, use the **Job** cmdlets.
    To get the job results, use the Receive-Job cmdlet.

    The *AsJob* parameter resembles using the Invoke-Command cmdlet to run a Start-Job command remotely.
    However, with *AsJob*, the job is created on the local computer, even though the job runs on a remote computer, and the results of the remote job are automatically returned to the local computer.

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251) and [about_Remote_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135184).

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Authentication
  description: |+
    Specifies one or more authentication types that an NFS client can use to access NFS shares.

    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

     -- Sys (AUTH_SYS authentication)
    - Krb5 (Kerberos v5 authentication)
    - Krb5i (Kerberos v5 authentication with integrity checking)
    - Krb5p (Kerberos v5 authentication with privacy)
    - All
    - Default

    If you specify All, Services for NFS configures Sys, Krb5, Krb5i, and Krb5p on the share.
    If you specify Default, Services for NFS configures Sys, Krb5, and Krb5i on the share.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Auth
  parameterValueGroup: sys, krb5, krb5i, krb5p, default, all
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CaseSensitiveLookup
  description: |+
    Specifies that the NFS client must perform case-sensitive lookups of file names for NFS shares that are mounted locally.

  defaultValue: "0"
  position: Named
  aliases: casesensitive, csl
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimSession" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DefaultAccessMode
  description: |+
    Specifies the default permission mode that an NFS client assigns for newly created files, in UNIX-style mode bits.
    The permissions that this property specifies are set for all new files created on mounted shares.

    With UNIX-style mode bits (also known as the three-digit octal notation), each numeral represents a different component of the permission set: user class, group class, and "others" class.

    Each of these digits is the sum of its component bits.
    As a result, specific bits add to the sum:

    The read bit adds 4 to its total (in binary 100).
    The write bit adds 2 to its total (in binary 010).
    The execute bit adds 1 to its total (in binary 001).

    Individual octal digit values represent the following:
    0 -- no permission
    1 -- x     execute
    2 -- w     write
    3 -- wx   write and execute
    4 -- r      read
    5 -- r-x   read and execute
    6 -- rw    read and write
    7 - rwx   read, write, and execute

    The following are examples of UNIX-style mode bits:

    777 = "-rwxrwxrwx" = rwx for all

    754 = "-rwxr-xr--" = rwx for owner, r-x for group, r-- for other

    124 = "--x-w-r--" = x for owner, w for group, r for other

  aliases: retry
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />

    By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ReadBufferSize
  description: |+
    Specifies the size of the read buffer (in kilobytes) that the NFS client uses.

  defaultValue: "32"
  position: Named
  aliases: rsize
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RpcTimeoutSec
  description: |+
    Specifies the time-out for a remote procedure call (RPC), in seconds, that the NFS client enforces for outstanding RPC calls.

  defaultValue: "8"
  position: Named
  aliases: timeout, RpcTimeout
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.
