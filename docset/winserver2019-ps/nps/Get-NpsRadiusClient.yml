  The **Get-NpsRadiusClient** cmdlet gets Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) clients.
  A RADIUS client uses a RADIUS server to manage authentication, authorization, and accounting requests that the client sends.
  A RADIUS client can be an access server, such as a dial-up server or wireless access point, or a RADIUS proxy.
