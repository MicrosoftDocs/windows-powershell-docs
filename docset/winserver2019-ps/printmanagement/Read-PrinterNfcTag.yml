  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  The **Read-PrinterNfcTag** cmdlet reads information about printers from the near field communication (NFC) tag that anyone taps against the default NFC reader for the system.
  The cmdlet returns the printer information that it reads as a table that contains the value of the **SharePath** property and the value and the **wsdAddress** property for the printers.
