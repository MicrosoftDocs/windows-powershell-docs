  The **Remove-RDRemoteApp** cmdlet removes a Windows Server 2012 RemoteApp program from a Remote Desktop deployment.

  RemoteApp allows Remote Desktop Services (RDS) to run a program remotely that appears as if it runs locally on a client computer.
  A RemoteApp program runs in its own resizable window and has its own entry on the taskbar.

  When you remove a RemoteApp program, users can no longer use that program as part of a Remote Desktop deployment.
  This cmdlet does not delete the program executable.
