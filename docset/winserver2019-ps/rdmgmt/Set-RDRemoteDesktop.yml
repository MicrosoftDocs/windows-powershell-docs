  The **Set-RDRemoteDesktop** cmdlet changes whether to publish a Remote Desktop connection to a collection.

  When you publish a Remote Desktop connection, the Remote Desktop Web Access (RD Web Access) server displays the Remote Desktop connection for the collection defined by the **CollectionName** parameter.
  RemoteApp and Desktop Connections that the user subscribes to also display published Remote Desktop connections.

  You can publish either RemoteApps or a Remote Desktop connection to a collection, but not both.
  Therefore, if you publish a Remote Desktop connection by using this cmdlet, it unpublishes any published RemoteApps.
