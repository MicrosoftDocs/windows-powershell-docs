    The `Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure.CimInstance` object is a wrapper class that displays Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) objects.
    The path after the pound sign (`#`) provides the namespace and class name for the underlying WMI object.

    The object consists of the following properties: 

    The list of application server security groups.
    Each security group is specified in the `Domain\GroupName` format. 

    The list of application server GPOs.
    Each GPO is specified in the `Domain\GPOName` format. 

    The properties of the connection to the application server.
    If there are no application servers configured, then the default value is NoE2EAuth, which means no end-to-end authentication is required. 

    Whether or not IPsec traffic protection is enabled.
    If there are no application servers configured, then the default value is Disabled.

  code: |-
    PS C:\> Get-DAAppServer -ComputerName edge1.corp.contoso.com
    SecurityGroupNameList : {corp.contoso.com\daappservergrp} 
    GpoName               : {corp.contoso.com\DirectAccess Application Server Settings} 
    ConnectionType        : E2EAuthOnlyToAppServer 
    TrafficProtection     : Enabled
  description: |-
    This example lists the application security groups and the application servers Group Policy Objects (GPOs) configured with DA.
    Since application server settings are global to DA configuration, the ConnectionType and, TrafficProtection are the same for all application servers.
    These settings can change using the Set-DAAppServerConnection cmdlet.
