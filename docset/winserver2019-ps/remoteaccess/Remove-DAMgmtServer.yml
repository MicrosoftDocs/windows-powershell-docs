    The list must be passed to this cmdlet to remove these servers from DA configuration.

description: |-
  The **Remove-DAMgmtServer** cmdlet removes the specified management servers from the DirectAccess (DA) deployment.
  The Management server refers to update servers, Domain Controllers and other servers.

  If admin tries to delete all the management servers by specifying the entire list when DA is deployed in a managed out configuration, then this cmdlet deletes all of the management servers except the last one in the list.

  The management server configuration is applicable globally to the entire DA deployment and therefore is not impacted by multi-site deployments.
