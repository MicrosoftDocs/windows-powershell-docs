  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.

  The **Remove-RemoteAccessLoadBalancerNode** cmdlet removes a server from the network load balancing (NLB) cluster.

  When a server is removed, DirectAccess (DA) and VPN configuration settings on it are also removed.

  When the last server from a cluster is removed, the DA and VPN configuration on it is not removed.

  A server can be removed from the NLB cluster even if it is not reachable.

  When VPN and DA configuration are cleared the Remote Access role is not uninstalled automatically.
