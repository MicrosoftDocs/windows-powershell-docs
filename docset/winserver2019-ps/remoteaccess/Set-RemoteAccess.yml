  code: |-
    PS C:\> Set-RemoteAccess -InternalInterface 'DomainConnection' -InternetInterface 'Public Network'
  description: |-
    This example will change the internal and external interfaces configured for DA.
    Since in our example setup, DA is deployed in edge topology, the cmdlet will look for the IP configured in ConnectToAddress while installing DA and compare it with the new internet interface IP to make sure that there is a match.

  name: Force
  description: "Forces the command to run without asking for user confirmation.\r\n                         \r\nWhen suppressed, the cmdlet assumes user confirmation for the following conditions. \r\n                         \r\n -- Changing the interfaces: This results in re-configuration which is time consuming and the server cannot accept connections during this time.\r\n\r\n"

  name: SslCertificate
  description: "Specifies the certificate that will be used to secure remote clients connectivity over HTTPS, in case of DA, or SSTP, in case of VPN. \r\n                         \r\n -- SSL certificate changes are allowed only within the bounds of the current value of the ConnectTo address (configurable through the Set-DAServer cmdlet), such as the subject name of the new certificate should always match ConnectTo.\r\nAll other certificates are rejected and the cmdlet errors out, even if all other criteria for an SSL certificate are satisfied.\r\nThis behavior is applicable irrespective of whether NAT is deployed or not and whether the server has a single network adapter or two network adapters. \r\n                         \r\n -- In a network load balancing scenario the changes take effect on all nodes.\r\nHence, the specified certificate is required to be present on all nodes in the cluster. \r\n                         \r\n ---- If the certificate is not found on one or more nodes, then this cmdlet displays an error. \r\n                         \r\n ---- If one or more nodes are down when changing the certificate, then the change applies only on the nodes that are up.\r\nBut the DA server GPO is updated to ensure that when these computers come up load balancing is in stopped state on them due to a certificate mismatch.\r\nFor the certificate change to take effect, the administrator needs to install a similar certificate on them and re-run this cmdlet.\r\n\r\n"

  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.
