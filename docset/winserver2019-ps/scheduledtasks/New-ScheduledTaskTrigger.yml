    This example registers a scheduled task that starts once.

    The first command creates a scheduled task action named Cmd and assigns the **ScheduledTaskAction** object to the $Sta variable.
    The second command creates a scheduled task trigger that starts the task once at 3:00 A.M and assigns the **ScheduledTaskTrigger** object to the $Stt variable.
    The third command registers the scheduled task Task01 to run the task action named Cmd once at 3:00 A.M.

uid: ScheduledTasks.New-ScheduledTaskTrigger
name: New-ScheduledTaskTrigger
description: |-
  The **New-ScheduledTaskTrigger** cmdlet creates and returns a new scheduled task trigger object.

  You can use a time-based trigger or an event-based trigger to start a task.
  Time-based triggers include starting a task at a specific time or starting a task multiple times on a daily or weekly schedule.
  Event-based triggers include starting a task when the system starts up or when a user logs on to the computer.
  Each task can contain one or more triggers, which means there are many ways that you can start a task.
  If a task has multiple triggers, Task Scheduler starts the task when any of the triggers occur.
