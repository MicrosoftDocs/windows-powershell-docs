parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete.

  defaultValue: None

  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimSession" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="NewDiskPolicy" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: NewDiskPolicy
  description: |+
    Manages the policy that will be applied to newly attached disks.
    New disk policy accepts the following settings; (only applies to disks that were not previously seen), The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - OnlineAll: (Same as current diskpartsanpolicy definition) All disks are automatically onlined regardless of bus-type or configuration.
    Can cause data loss if used on shared bus disks improperly.
    - OfflineAll: (Same as current diskpartsanpolicy definition) All disks are automatically left offline, regardless of the bus-type.
    (not recommended for Windows Client as this would result in attached USB disk not being available by default).
    - OfflineInternal: Leaves all newly attached disks, which are non-shared storage busses (such as ATA, SATA, USB) offline by default.
    (new for Windows Server® 2012).
    - OfflineShared: Leaves all newly attached disks which are on a sharable bus (iSCSI, FC, SAS) offline by default.

    In Windows Server 2016, including Nano Server, the default policy is OfflineShared.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Unknown, OnlineAll, OfflineShared, OfflineAll, OfflineInternal
- type: <xref href="ScrubPolicy" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ScrubPolicy
  description: |+
    Specifies the policy for the files that the automatic data integrity scanner scrubs.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Off: No files are scrubbed.
    - Integrity Streams: Only files with integrity streams are scrubbed.
    - All: All files are scrubbed.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Off, IntegrityStreams, All
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
