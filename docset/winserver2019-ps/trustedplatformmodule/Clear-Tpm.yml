description: |-
  The **Clear-Tpm** cmdlet resets the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to its default state.
  A reset removes the owner authorization value and any keys stored in the TPM.
  To reset a TPM, you must provide a valid owner authorization value.
  You can enter an owner authorization value or specify a file that contains the value.
  If you do not provide a value, the cmdlet attempts to use a value stored in the registry.

  For more information on TPM, see the [Trusted Platform Module Technology Overview](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj131725.aspx) in the TechNet library.
