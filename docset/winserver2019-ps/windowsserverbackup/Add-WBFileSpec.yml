  code: |-
    PS C:\> $Filespec1 = New-WBFileSpec -FileSpec C:\Sample\1.jpg
    PS C:\> $Filespec2 = New-WBFileSpec -FileSpec C:\Sample\*.txt
    PS C:\> $Filespec3 = New-WBFileSpec -FileSpec C:\Sample\*.mp3 -Exclude
    PS C:\> Add-WBFileSpec -Policy $Policy $Filespec1,$Filespec2,$Filespec3
  description: |-
    This example adds three backup file specifications to the **WBPolicy** object in the variable named $Policy.

    The first command assigns the file named C:\sample\1.jpg to the variable named $Filespec1.

    The second command assigns the files that match the wildcard specification C:\Sample\*.txt (text files in the C:\Sample directory) to the variable named $Filespec2.

    The third command assigns the files that match the wildcard specification C:\Sample\*.mp3 txt (MP3 files in the C:\Sample directory) to the variable named $Filespec3.
    Because this command includes the *Exclude* parameter, the backup from this policy excludes MP3 files in C:\Sample.

    The fourth command adds the file specifications in $Filespec1,  $Filespec2, and $Filespec3 to the backup policy in the variable named $Policy.

    PS C:\> $Filespecarray = ($Filespec1, $Filespec2, $Filespec3) 
    PS C:\> Add-WBFileSpec -Policy $Policy $Filespecarray
  description: |-
    This example adds an array of backup file specifications to a backup policy.

    The first command assigns the file specifications in the variables named $Filespec1, $Filespec2, and $Filespec3 to the array in the variable named $Filespecarray.

    The second command adds the array of file specifications in $Filespecarray to the **WBPolicy** object in the variable named $Policy.

description: |-
  The **Add-WBFileSpec** cmdlet adds a backup file specification, which specifies the items to include in or exclude from a backup, to a backup policy.
  A **WBFileSpec** object contains the backup file specification, and a **WBPolicy** object contains the backup policy.
  The **WBFileSpec** object can include or exclude multiple files, folders, or volumes.
  You can create a list of items to include or exclude by using the [New-WBFileSpec](./New-WBFileSpec.yml) cmdlet and then using the **Add-WBFileSpec** cmdlet to update the **WBPolicy** object.

  Before you can add a backup file specification to a **WBPolicy** object, you must put the **WBPolicy** object in edit mode.
  To put the **WBPolicy** object in edit mode for a policy that you set as the scheduled backup policy, use the Get-WBPolicy cmdlet with the *Editable* parameter.
  The [New-WBPolicy](./New-WBPolicy.yml) cmdlet creates a new **WBPolicy** object that is already in edit mode.

  To use this cmdlet, you must be a member of the Administrators group or Backup Operators group.
