    This example adds a list of volumes for backup to the **WBPolicy** object.

    The first command stores the output of the [Get-WBVolume](./Get-WBVolume.yml) cmdlet in the variable named $Volumes.

    The second command calls the [Get-WBPolicy](./Get-WBPolicy.yml) cmdlet and assigns the result to the $Policy variable.

    The third command adds the volumes in the $Volumes variable to the backup policy.
