    If you do not use this parameter, the cmdlet returns a **WBJob** object that contains the currently running backup or recovery operation.

- title: 'Example 1: Get backup status'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> $Policy = Get-WBPolicy
    PS C:\> Start-WBBackup -Policy $Policy -Async
    PS C:\> $Job = Get-WBJob
  description: |-
    This example gets the status of the currently running backup or recovery operation.

    The first command gets a backup policy object that contains the backup policy for the current computer and stores this policy in the variable named $Policy.

    The second command starts the backup job by using the policy in the variable named $Policy.
    Because the command uses the *Async* parameter, the backup job does not display status messages as it runs.

    The third command gets status information about the backup job and assigns it to the variable named $Job.
    Because the previous command specified the *Async* parameter, you can use this cmdlet to obtain this information.
