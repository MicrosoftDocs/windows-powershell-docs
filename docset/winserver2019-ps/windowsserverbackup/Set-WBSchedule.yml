    When you set this policy on the computer, backups are created daily at the specified times.

    The first command stores the result of the **Get-WBPolicy** in the variable named $Policy.

    The second command sets the backup schedule in the $Policy variable.
    The *Schedule* parameter indicates the times.

  The **Set-WBSchedule** cmdlet sets the current schedule for backups and saves the settings in the **WBPolicy** object.

  The **WBPolicy** object must be in edit mode.
  To put the **WBPolicy** object in edit mode, use the [Get-WBPolicy](./Get-WBPolicy.yml) cmdlet with the *Editable* parameter.
  The [New-WBPolicy](./New-WBPolicy.yml) cmdlet creates a **WBPolicy** object that is already in edit mode.

  To use this cmdlet, you must be a member of the Administrators group or Backup Operators group.
