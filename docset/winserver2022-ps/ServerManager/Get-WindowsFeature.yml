parameters:

  name: ComputerName
  description: |+
    Gets the list of available features from the specified remote computer that is running Windows Server.
    The parameter accepts only one computer name.
    If this parameter is not added, or no computer name is specified, the default target is the local computer.
    Valid values for the parameter include a NetBIOS name, an IP address, or a fully qualified domain name of a remote computer.

    To use a remote computer's IP address as the value of this parameter, your command must include the `Credential` parameter.
    The computer must either be configured for HTTPS transport, or the IP address of the remote computer must be included in the WinRM TrustedHosts list on the local computer.
    For information about adding a computer name to the WinRM TrustedHosts list, see "How to Add a Computer to the Trusted Host List" in [about_Remote_Troubleshooting](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=135188).

    Quotation marks are optional.

    -- "UserName"
    -- "Domain\User"
    -- "User@Domain.com"

  name: Vhd
  description: |+
    Specifies the path to an offline VHD.
    The path can either point to a VHD file, or to a location on which the VHD is already mounted by using Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tools.

    The VHD can be on a local disk on the target computer, or on a network shared folder.
    If the VHD is in a network shared folder, then the value of this parameter is a UNC path to the VHD.
    In this case, the computer account of the computer that you are using to mount the VHD must have read and write permissions (Read/Write permissions in the File Sharing dialog box, or Full Control on the Security tab of the folder Properties dialog box) on the shared folder, or the VHD will not be accessible.
    Local loopback UNC paths are not supported.
    Use either of the following formats for the computer account: DOMAIN\SERVERNAME$ or SERVERNAME$.

    Add the `ComputerName` parameter to specify the target computer you want to use to mount the VHD.
    If the `ComputerName` parameter is not specified, then the local computer is used.
    The computer that you are using to mount the VHD must be running Windows Server.
    Any local path, such as D:\myFolder, that is specified by using this parameter is always relative to the target computer.
