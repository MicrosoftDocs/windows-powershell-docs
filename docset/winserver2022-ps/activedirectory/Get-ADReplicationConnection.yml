parameters:
- type: <xref href="ADAuthType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AuthType
  description: |+
    Specifies the authentication method to use.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Negotiate or 0
    - Basic or 1

    The default authentication method is Negotiate.

    A Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection is required for the Basic authentication method.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Negotiate, Basic
- type: <xref href="PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Credential
  description: |+
    Specifies the user account credentials to use to perform this task.
    The default credentials are the credentials of the currently logged on user unless the cmdlet is run from an Active Directory PowerShell provider drive.
    If the cmdlet is run from such a provider drive, the account associated with the drive is the default.

    To specify this parameter, you can type a user name, such as User1 or Domain01\User01 or you can specify a **PSCredential** object.
    If you specify a user name for this parameter, the cmdlet prompts for a password.

    You can also create a **PSCredential** object by using a script or by using the **Get-Credential** cmdlet.
    You can then set the *Credential* parameter to the **PSCredential** object.

    If the acting credentials do not have directory-level permission to perform the task, Active Directory PowerShell returns a terminating error.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Filter
  description: |+
    Specifies a query string that retrieves Active Directory objects.
    This string uses the PowerShell Expression Language syntax.
    The PowerShell Expression Language syntax provides rich type-conversion support for value types received by the *Filter* parameter.
    The syntax uses an in-order representation, which means that the operator is placed between the operand and the value.
    For more information about the *Filter* parameter, type `Get-Help about_ActiveDirectory_Filter`.

    Syntax:

    The following syntax uses Backus-Naur form to show how to use the PowerShell Expression Language for this parameter.

    \<filter\>  ::= "{" \<FilterComponentList\> "}"

    \<FilterComponentList\> ::= \<FilterComponent\> | \<FilterComponent\> \<JoinOperator\> \<FilterComponent\> | \<NotOperator\>  \<FilterComponent\>

    \<FilterComponent\> ::= \<attr\> \<FilterOperator\> \<value\> | "(" \<FilterComponent\> ")"

    \<FilterOperator\> ::= "-eq" | "-le" | "-ge" | "-ne" | "-lt" | "-gt"| "-approx" | "-bor" | "-band" | "-recursivematch" | "-like" | "-notlike"

    \<JoinOperator\> ::= "-and" | "-or"

    \<NotOperator\> ::= "-not"

    \<attr\> ::= \<PropertyName\> | \<LDAPDisplayName of the attribute\>

    \<value\>::= \<compare this value with an \<attr\> by using the specified \<FilterOperator\>\>

    For a list of supported types for \<value\>, see about_ActiveDirectory_ObjectModel.

    Note: PowerShell wildcards other than *, such as ?, are not supported by the *Filter* syntax.

    Note: To query using LDAP query strings, use the *LDAPFilter* parameter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ADReplicationConnection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an Active Directory object by providing one of the following property values.
    The identifier in parentheses is the LDAP display name for the attribute.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - A distinguished name
    - A GUID (objectGUID)

    The cmdlet searches the default naming context or partition to find the object.
    If two or more objects are found, the cmdlet returns a non-terminating error.

    This parameter can also get this object through the pipeline or you can set this parameter to an object instance.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Properties
  description: |+
    Specifies the properties of the output object to retrieve from the server.
    Use this parameter to retrieve properties that are not included in the default set.

    Specify properties for this parameter as a comma-separated list of names.
    To display all of the attributes that are set on the object, specify * (asterisk).

    To specify an individual extended property, use the name of the property.
    For properties that are not default or extended properties, you must specify the LDAP display name of the attribute.

    To retrieve properties and display them for an object, you can use the Get-* cmdlet associated with the object and pass the output to the **Get-Member** cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Property
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Server
  description: |+
    The default authentication method is Negotiate.

    A Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection is required for the Basic authentication method.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: ActiveDirectory.Get-ADReplicationConnection
name: Get-ADReplicationConnection
description: |-
  The **Get-ADReplicationConnection** cmdlet returns a specific Active Directory replication connection or a set of Active Directory replication connection objects based on a specified filter.
  Connections are used to enable domain controllers to replicate with each other.
  A connection defines a one-way, inbound route from one domain controller (the source), to another domain controller (the destination).
  The Knowledge Consistency Checker (KCC) reuses existing connections where it can, deletes unused connections, and creates new connections if none exist that meet the current need.
