### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Returns the replication metadata for a set of one or more replication partners.
module: ActiveDirectory
notes: |-
  * The default behavior for this cmdlet is to prompt for server identity. Other tools that have been made available in prior releases of Windows Server to manage replication partnerships include Active Directory Sites and Services and the Repadmin.exe tool. If this cmdlet is aliased, it should use ReplSummary as the alias name value.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="ADAuthType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AuthType
  description: |+
    Specifies the authentication method to use.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Negotiate or 0
    - Basic or 1

    The default authentication method is Negotiate.

    A Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection is required for the Basic authentication method.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Negotiate, Basic
- type: <xref href="PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Credential
  description: |+
    Specifies a user account that has permission to perform this action.
    The default is the current user.

    Type a user name, such as User01 or Domain01\User01, or enter a **PSCredential** object, such as one generated by the **Get-Credential** cmdlet.
    If you type a user name, you will be prompted for a password.

    This parameter is not supported by any providers installed with Windows PowerShell.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: EnumerationServer
  description: |+
    Specifies the Active Directory Domain Services instance to connect to, by providing one of the following values for a corresponding domain name or directory server.
    The service may be any of the following:  Active Directory Lightweight Domain Services, Active Directory Domain Services or Active Directory snapshot instance.

    Specify the instance in one of the following ways:  

    Domain name values:

    - Fully qualified domain name
    - NetBIOS name

    Directory server values: 

    - Fully qualified directory server name
    - NetBIOS name
    - Fully qualified directory server name and port

    The default value for this parameter is determined by one of the following methods in the order that they are listed:

    - By using the *Server* value from objects passed through the pipeline
    - By using the server information associated with the Active Directory Domain Services Windows PowerShell provider drive, when the cmdlet runs in that drive
    - By using the domain of the computer running Windows PowerShell

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Filter
  description: |+
    Specifies a filter in the provider's format or language.
    The value of this parameter qualifies the *Path* parameter.
    The syntax of the filter, including the use of wildcards, depends on the provider.
    Filters are more efficient than other parameters, because the provider applies them when retrieving the objects, rather than having Windows PowerShell filter the objects after they are retrieved.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Partition
  description: |+
    The default authentication method is Negotiate.

    A Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection is required for the Basic authentication method.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "2"
  aliases: NC, NamingContext
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ADPartnerType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PartnerType
  description: |+
    Specifies an enumeration of the replication types returned by this cmdlet.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Inbound
    - Outbound
    - Both

  defaultValue: None
  position: "3"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Inbound, Outbound, Both
- type: <xref href="ADScopeType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Scope
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the scope type for the Target parameter when used as input.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Server
    - Site
    - Domain
    - Forest

    Server

    Site

    Domain

    Forest

  defaultValue: None
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Server, Domain, Forest, Site
- type: <xref href="Object" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Target
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the target for returning replication partner metadata as either one or more domain controllers, sites, domains, or forests.
    If multiple values for the target are to be specified, they need to be separated by commas.
    This parameter will return results for all the domain controllers specified or for part of the specified container.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: Name, HostName, Site, Domain, Forest
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: ActiveDirectory.Get-ADReplicationPartnerMetadata
name: Get-ADReplicationPartnerMetadata
description: |-
  The **Get-ADReplicationPartnerMetadata** cmdlet returns an Active Directory replication partner metadata object for each of its replication partners which contains all of the relevant replication data for the partners involved.
  This includes attributes such as **LastReplicationSuccess** or **LastReplicationAttempt** and other data specific to each pairing of replication partners.
  If the results are too verbose for your needs, you can use the *Partition* parameter to specify a partition to narrow down the results.
  Optionally, you can use the *Filter* parameter to narrow down results as well.
  If no partition or filter are specified for the results, the default naming context is used and metadata for all replication partners is returned.
