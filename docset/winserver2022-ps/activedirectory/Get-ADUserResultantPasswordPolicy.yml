parameters:
- type: <xref href="ADAuthType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AuthType
  description: |+
    Specifies the authentication method to use.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Negotiate or 0
    - Basic or 1

    The default authentication method is Negotiate.

    A Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection is required for the Basic authentication method.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Negotiate, Basic
- type: <xref href="PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Credential
  description: |+
    Specifies the user account credentials to use to perform this task.
    The default credentials are the credentials of the currently logged on user unless the cmdlet is run from an Active Directory PowerShell provider drive.
    If the cmdlet is run from such a provider drive, the account associated with the drive is the default.

    To specify this parameter, you can type a user name, such as User1 or Domain01\User01 or you can specify a **PSCredential** object.
    If you specify a user name for this parameter, the cmdlet prompts for a password.

    You can also create a **PSCredential** object by using a script or by using the **Get-Credential** cmdlet.
    You can then set the *Credential* parameter to the **PSCredential** object.

    If the acting credentials do not have directory-level permission to perform the task, Active Directory PowerShell returns a terminating error.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ADUser" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an Active Directory user object by providing one of the following property values.
    The identifier in parentheses is the LDAP display name for the attribute.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - A distinguished name
    - A GUID (objectGUID) 
    - Security identifier (objectSid)
    - SAM account name (sAMAccountName)

    The cmdlet searches the default naming context or partition to find the object.
    If two or more objects are found, the cmdlet returns a non-terminating error.

    This parameter can also get this object through the pipeline or you can set this parameter to an object instance.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Partition
  description: |+
    Specifies the distinguished name of an Active Directory partition.
    The distinguished name must be one of the naming contexts on the current directory server.
    The cmdlet searches this partition to find the object defined by the *Identity* parameter.

    In many cases, a default value will be used for the *Partition* parameter if no value is specified. 
    The rules for determining the default value are given below. 
    Note that rules listed first are evaluated first and once a default value can be determined, no further rules will be evaluated.

    In AD DS environments, a default value for *Partition* will be set in the following cases: 

    - If the *Identity* parameter is set to a distinguished name, the default value of Partition is automatically generated from this distinguished name.
    - If running cmdlets from an Active Directory provider drive, the default value of *Partition* is automatically generated from the current path in the drive. 
    - If none of the previous cases apply, the default value of *Partition* will be set to the default partition or naming context of the target domain.

    In AD LDS environments, a default value for Partition will be set in the following cases:

    - If the *Identity* parameter is set to a distinguished name, the default value of *Partition* is automatically generated from this distinguished name. 
    - If running cmdlets from an Active Directory provider drive, the default value of *Partition* is automatically generated from the current path in the drive. 
    - If the target AD LDS instance has a default naming context, the default value of *Partition* will be set to the default naming context. 
    To specify a default naming context for an AD LDS environment, set the **msDS-defaultNamingContext** property of the Active Directory directory service agent (DSA) object (**nTDSDSA**) for the AD LDS instance. 
    - If none of the previous cases apply, the *Partition* parameter will not take any default value.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Server
  description: |+
    Specifies the AD DS instance to connect to, by providing one of the following values for a corresponding domain name or directory server.
    The service may be any of the following: AD LDS, AD DS, or Active Directory snapshot instance.

    Specify the AD DS instance in one of the following ways:  

    Domain name values:

    - Fully qualified domain name
    - NetBIOS name

    Directory server values:  

    - Fully qualified directory server name
    - NetBIOS name
    - Fully qualified directory server name and port

    The default value for this parameter is determined by one of the following methods in the order that they are listed:

    - By using the *Server* value from objects passed through the pipeline
    - By using the server information associated with the AD DS Windows PowerShell provider drive, when the cmdlet runs in that drive
    - By using the domain of the computer running Windows PowerShell

  defaultValue: None

uid: ActiveDirectory.Get-ADUserResultantPasswordPolicy
name: Get-ADUserResultantPasswordPolicy
description: |-
  The **Get-ADUserResultantPasswordPolicy** cmdlet gets the resultant password policy object (RSoP) for a user.
  The RSoP is defined by the Active Directory attribute named **msDS-ResultantPSO**.

  A user can have multiple password policy objects (PSOs) associated with it, but only one PSO is the RSoP.
  A PSO is associated with a user when the PSO applies directly to the user or when the PSO applies to an Active Directory group that contains the user.
  When more than one PSO policy is associated with a user or group, the RSoP value defines the PSO to apply.

  The resultant password policy or RSoP for a user is determined by using the following procedure: 

  - If only one PSO is associated with a user, this PSO is the RSoP.
  - If more than one PSO is associated with a user, the PSO that applies directly to the user is the RSoP.
  - If more than one PSO applies directly to the user, the PSO with the lowest **msDS-PasswordSettingsPrecedence** attribute value is the RSoP and this event is logged as a warning in the Active Directory event log.
  The lowest attribute value represents the highest PSO precedence.
  For example, if the **msDS-PasswordSettingsPrecedence** values of two PSOs are 100 and 200, the PSO with the attribute value of 100 is the RSoP. 
  - If there are no PSOs that apply directly to the user, the PSOs of the global security groups that have the user as a member are compared.
  The PSO with the lowest **msDS-PasswordSettingsPrecedence** value is the RSoP.

  The *Identity* parameter specifies the Active Directory user.
  You can identify a user by its distinguished name, GUID, security identifier (SID), or Security Account Manager (SAM) account name.
  You can also set the parameter to a user object variable, such as `$<localUserObject>` or pass a user object through the pipeline to the *Identity* parameter.
  For example, you can use the **Get-ADUser** cmdlet to retrieve a user object and then pass the object through the pipeline to the Get-ADUserResultantPasswordPolicy cmdlet.
