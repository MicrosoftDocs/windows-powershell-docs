  * This cmdlet does not work with Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS).
  * This cmdlet does not work with an Active Directory snapshot.
  * This cmdlet does not work with a read-only domain controller.
  * This cmdlet must be run from an elevated PowerShell session.
  * To successfully install a managed service account, the service account should have the *PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword* parameter option set first by using either the New-ADServiceAccount or Set-ADServiceAccount cmdlet first. Otherwise, installation will fail.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SecureString" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AccountPassword
  description: |+
    Specifies the account password as a secure string.
    This parameter enables you to specify the password of a standalone managed service account that you have provisioned and is ignored for group managed service accounts.
    This is required when you are installing a standalone managed service account on a server located on a segmented network (site) with read-only domain controllers (for example, a perimeter network or DMZ).
    In this case you should create the standalone managed service account, link it with the appropriate computer account, and assign a well-known password that must be passed when installing the standalone managed service account on the server on the read-only domain controller site with no access to writable domain controllers.
    If you pass both *AccountPassword* and *PromptForPassword* parameters, the *AccountPassword* parameter takes precedence.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ADAuthType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AuthType
  description: |+
    Specifies the authentication method to use.
    Possible values for this parameter include: The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Negotiate or 0
    - Basic or 1

    The default authentication method is Negotiate.

    A Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection is required for the Basic authentication method.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Negotiate, Basic
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force
  description: |+
    Forces installation of the service account.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="ADServiceAccount" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an Active Directory group object by providing one of the following values.
    The identifier in parentheses is the LDAP display name for the attribute.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - A distinguished name
    - A GUID (objectGUID) 
    - A security identifier (objectSid) 
    - A security accounts manager account name (sAMAccountName)

    The cmdlet searches the default naming context or partition to find the object.
    If two or more objects are found, the cmdlet returns a non-terminating error.

    This parameter can also get this object through the pipeline or you can set this parameter to an object instance.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PromptForPassword
  description: |+
    Indicates that you can enter the password of a standalone managed service account that you have pre-provisioned and ignored for group managed service accounts.
    This is required when you are installing a standalone managed service account on a server located on a segmented network (site) with no access to writable domain controllers, but only read-only domain controllers (RODCs) (e.g.
    perimeter network or DMZ).
    In this case you should create the standalone managed service account, link it with the appropriate computer account, and assign a well-known password that must be passed when installing the standalone managed service account on the server on the RODC-only site.
    If you pass both *AccountPassword* and *PromptForPassword* parameters the *AccountPassword* parameter takes precedence.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: wi
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: ActiveDirectory.Install-ADServiceAccount
name: Install-ADServiceAccount
description: |-
  The **Install-ADServiceAccount** cmdlet installs an existing Active Directory managed service account on the computer on which the cmdlet is run.
  This cmdlet verifies that the computer is eligible to host the managed service account.
  The cmdlet also makes the required changes locally so that the managed service account password can be managed without requiring any user action.

  The *Identity* parameter specifies the Active Directory managed service account to install.
  You can identify a managed service account by its distinguished name, GUID, security identifier (SID), or security accounts manager (SAM) account name.
  You can also set the parameter to a managed service account object variable, such as `$<localServiceAccountObject>` or pass a managed service account object through the pipeline to the *Identity* parameter.
  For example, you can use Get-ADServiceAccount to get a managed service account object and then pass the object through the pipeline to the Install-ADServiceAccount.

  The *AccountPassword* parameter allows you to pass a secure string that contains the password of a standalone managed service account and is ignored for group managed service accounts.
  Alternatively, you can use *PromptForPassword* parameter to prompt for the standalone managed service account password.
  You must enter the password of a standalone managed service account if you want to install an account that you have provisioned.
  This is required when you are installing a standalone managed service account on a server located on a segmented network (site) with read-only domain controllers (for example, a perimeter network or DMZ).
  In this case you should create the standalone managed service account, link it with the appropriate computer account, and assign a well-known password that must be passed when installing the standalone managed service account on the server on the read-only domain controller site.
  If you pass both *AccountPassword* and *PromptForPassword* parameters, the *AccountPassword* parameter takes precedence.
