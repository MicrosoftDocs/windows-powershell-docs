  name: ApplicationPoolIdentity
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet the identity that the Network Device Enrollment Service (NDES) uses when communicating with the certification authority (CA).
    This parameter is only valid when NDES is using a remote CA.
    If the CA is local, the application pool identity account cannot be used.

  The **Install-AdcsNetworkDeviceEnrollmentService** cmdlet performs the configuration of the Network Device Enrollment Service (NDES) role service.

  To remove the NDES role service, use the **Uninstall-AdcsNetworkDeviceEnrollmentService** cmdlet.

  You can import the cmdlet by running the following commands from Windows PowerShell:

  - `Import-Module ServerManager`
  - `Add-WindowsFeature Adcs-Device-Enrollment`

  Int is equivalent to Int32 in the [.NET Framework](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ya5y69ds.aspx).
