### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Installs a new domain controller in an Active Directory domain.
module: ADDSDeployment
notes: |-
  * By default, this cmdlet always prompts for confirmation. To bypass confirmation, you need to include the **Confirm** parameter and specify a value of `$false`. For example, `-Confirm:$false`.
  * By default, this cmdlet is always run when executed. To see what will happen if the cmdlet runs without executing or committing installation changes, first run the cmdlet using the ***WhatIf** parameter to show what would happen.

  name: InstallationMediaPath
  description: |+
    Indicates the location of the installation media that is used to install a new domain controller.

  defaultValue: "NULL"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: InstallDns
  description: |+
    Indicates the cmdlet installs and configures the DNS Server service on the domain controller.
    For domain controller installation, if this parameter is left unspecified and the current domain already hosts and stores the DNS names for the domain, then the default for this parameter is $True and the DNS server is installed.
    Otherwise, if DNS domain names are hosted outside of Active Directory, the default is `$False` and no DNS server is installed.

    To test if DNS domain names are hosted outside of Active Directory, this cmdlet uses a start of authority (SOA) type DNS query.
    For instance, if the value of **DomainName** is corp.contoso.com, Active Directory performs an SOA query for corp.contoso.com and ensures that the zone name in the response is corp.contoso.com.

  defaultValue: "NULL"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: LogPath
  description: |+
    Specifies the fully qualified, non-UNC path to a directory on a fixed disk of the local computer that will contain the domain log files, for example, `C:\Windows\Logs`.
    The default is `%SYSTEMROOT%\NTDS`.

  defaultValue: "NULL"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MoveInfrastructureOperationMasterRoleIfNecessary
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet transfers the infrastructure master role to the domain controller being installed.
    To successfully complete the transfer, the **NoGlobalCatalog** parameter must be included as well.
    Do not specify this parameter if you want the infrastructure master role to remain where it currently is.

  defaultValue: "NULL"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: NoDnsOnNetwork
  description: |+
    Indicates that the DNS service is not available on the network.
    This parameter is used only when the IP setting of the network adapter for this computer is not configured with the name of a DNS server for name resolution.
    It indicates that a DNS server is installed on this computer for name resolution.
    Otherwise, the IP settings of the network adapter must first be configured with the address of a DNS server.

    Omitting this parameter (the default) indicates that the TCP/IP client settings of the network adapter on this server computer is used to contact a DNS server.
    Therefore, if you are not specifying this parameter, ensure that TCP/IP client settings are first configured with a preferred DNS server address.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: NoGlobalCatalog
  description: |+
    Indicates that the RODC will not be a global catalog server.
    By default, the domain controller that you are installing is a global catalog server.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: NoRebootOnCompletion
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet does not restart the computer upon the completion of the operation to install the domain controller.
    By default, if this parameter is omitted the computer will restart upon the completion of the install operation.
    As a general rule, Microsoft support recommends that you not use this parameter except for testing or troubleshooting purposes because once configuration has completed the server will not function correctly as either a member server or a DC until it is rebooted.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ReadOnlyReplica
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet installs the domain controller as an RODC for an existing domain.

  defaultValue: "FALSE"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ReplicationSourceDC
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the domain controller to be used as the source for replicating to this domain controller.

  defaultValue: "NULL"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SecureString" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SafeModeAdministratorPassword
  description: |+
    Supplies the password for the administrator account when the computer is started in Safe Mode or a variant of Safe Mode, such as Directory Services Restore Mode.
    If no value is specified for this parameter, the cmdlet prompts you to enter and confirm a masked password.
    If specified with a value, the value must be a secure string.

    Supplies the password for the administrator account when the computer is started in Safe Mode or a variant of Safe Mode, such as Directory Services Restore Mode.
    You must supply a password that meets the password complexity rules of the domain and the password cannot be blank.
    If specified with a value, the value must be a secure string.

    If this parameter is not specified, the cmdlet prompts you to enter and confirm a masked password.
    This is the preferred usage when running the cmdlet interactively.
    If additionally there are no other arguments specified with the cmdlet, you is prompted to enter a masked password for this parameter but no confirmation of the password entered is made.
    This is not recommended as it could allow a mistyped password to be configured.
    Another available advanced option is to use the **ConvertTo-SecureString** cmdlet and specify the password string inline as unmasked console input, which is also not a recommended security best practice in production deployments.

  defaultValue: <mandatory>
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SiteName
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of an existing site where you can place the new domain controller.
    The default value depends on the type of installation.
    For a new forest, the default is Default-First-Site-Name.
    For all other installations, the default is the site that is associated with the subnet that includes the IP address of this server.
    If no such site exists, the default is the site of the replication source domain controller.

  defaultValue: <mandatory>
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SkipAutoConfigureDns
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet skips automatic configuration of the DNS client settings, forwarders, and root hints.
    This parameter is in effect only if the DNS Server service is already installed.

  defaultValue: "NULL"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SkipPreChecks
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet performs only a base set of validations.
    This behavior is equivalent to the validations that were performed when using `Dcpromo.exe` in earlier versions of Windows Server to add a new domain controller.
    When this switch parameter is set, it specifies that additional preliminary checks should be bypassed.
    For more information on the scope of these additional preliminary checks that the ADDSDeployment module performs by default when using Windows Server 2016, refer to the table in the section "ADPrep and Prerequisite Checking Architecture" in [AD DS Simplified Administration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=237244).

  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: UseExistingAccount
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet attaches a server to an existing RODC account.
    If specified, a member of the Domain Admins group or a delegated user can run this cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "FALSE"
