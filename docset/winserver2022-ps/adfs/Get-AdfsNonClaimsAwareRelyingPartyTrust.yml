  The **Get-AdfsNonClaimsAwareRelyingPartyTrust** cmdlet gets the properties of a relying party trust for a non-claims-aware web application or service.

  A non-claims aware relying party trust is a relying party trust for web applications or services that do not rely directly on Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) to issue tokens, but instead rely on a third party that accesses such tokens and transforms them into what applications understand.
  A non-claims-aware relying party trust is useful for defining authentication and authorization policies for web applications and services that do not rely on AD FS tokens.
  The Web Application Proxy requests such tokens for pre-authentication to web applications or services that have corresponding non-claims-aware relying party trusts for requests that come from outside the network through the proxy.
