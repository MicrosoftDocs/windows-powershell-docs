- title: 'Example 1: Upgrade an AD RMS server'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> $mySecureStringPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString -String <password> -AsPlainText -Force
    PS C:\> $myCred = Get-Credential
    PS C:\> Update-ADRMS -PrivateKeyPassword $mySecureStringPassword -ServiceAccount $myCred
  description: |-
    This example upgrades an AD RMS server and cluster that is using a cluster key password.
    The password must be specified securely as console input.
    The **Get-Credential** cmdlet will launch a popup dialog to enter the AD RMS Service Account credentials (username and password) that are also required to upgrade AD RMS.

- title: 'Example 2: Upgrade an AD RMS server to cryptographic mode 2'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> $myCred = Get-Credential
    PS C:\> Update-ADRMS -UpdateCryptographicModeOnly -ServiceAccount $myCred
  description: |-
    This example updates an AD RMS server that is using a cluster key password to cryptographic mode 2.
    The **Get-Credential** command will launch a popup dialog to enter the AD RMS Service Account credentials (username and password) which are required for this update.
    The cluster key password is not required; but if the server is using CSP key storage, the *NewCspName* parameter must be included.
