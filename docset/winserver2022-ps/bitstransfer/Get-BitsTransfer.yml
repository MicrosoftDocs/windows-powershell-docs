    Indicates that this cmdlet gets BITS transfer jobs that are owned by all users.
    If this parameter is not specified, only jobs that are owned by the current user are returned.
    This parameter requires administrative credentials.

  name: JobId
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of BITS jobs by job ID.
    Only the BITS jobs that include a job ID in this array are returned.
    If **BitsJob** objects are piped to this cmdlet, their job IDs are used as the values of this parameter.

  defaultValue: None

    Specifies an array of BITS jobs based on job name.
    Only BITS jobs with job names that match a name in this array are returned.
    You can use standard wildcard characters  such as the asterisk (*) and the question mark (?).
    Or, you can use a range operator such as"\[a-r\]".

    For example, you can use any of the following commands:

    `Get-BitsTransfer -Name "BITS*"`

    `Get-BitsTransfer -Name "BITS Transfer"`

    `Get-BitsTransfer -Name "BITS Transfe[a-r]"`

    A combination of the wildcard character and range operators is also possible.

  The **Get-BitsTransfer** cmdlet retrieves a set of Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) transfer jobs.
  By default, the cmdlet returns the jobs that are owned by the current user.
  However, if you have administrative credentials, you can specify the *AllUsers* parameter so that the command returns jobs that are owned by all users.
  The returned jobs can be filtered by name or ID.
  The jobs are represented by **BitsJob** objects.
