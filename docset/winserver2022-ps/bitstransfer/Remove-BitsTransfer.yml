  code: |-
    PS C:\> Get-BitsTransfer | Remove-BitsTransfer
  description: |-
    This command cancels all the BITS transfer jobs that are owned by the current user.

    The output of the **Get-BitsTransfer** cmdlet is piped to the **Remove-BitsTransfer** cmdlet.

  code: |-
    C:\PS>$Bits = Get-BitsTransfer -AllUsers
    PS C:\> Remove-BitsTransfer -BitsJob $Bits
  description: |-
    This command cancels all the BITS transfer jobs on the computer.

    The first command gets all the **BitsJob** objects on the computer and then stores them in the $Bits variable.

    The second command uses the *BitsJob* parameter to pass the **BitsJob** objects that are stored in the $Bits variable to the **Remove-BitsTransfer** cmdlet.

  The **Remove-BitsTransfer** cmdlet cancels a Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) transfer job.
  It deletes the underlying transfer job, removes any temporary files from the client, and deletes the associated **BitsJob** object.

  When the **Remove-BitsTransfer** cmdlet cancels a transfer job, it deletes all the transfers.
  Consider a scenario is which you are transferring three files.
  One file is completely transferred, one file is pending, and one file is currently being transferred.
  In this scenario, **Remove-BitsTransfer** cancels the whole transfer and deletes the underlying files.
  Any files that were already transferred are not available after you use the **Remove-BitsTransfer** cmdlet to cancel the transfer job.
  Optionally, you can use the **Complete-BitsTransfer** cmdlet to commit any files that are completely downloaded and to cancel the pending and current transfers.
  The transferred file is not be deleted and is available.
