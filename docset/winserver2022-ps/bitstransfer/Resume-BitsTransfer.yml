### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Resumes a BITS transfer job.
module: BitsTransfer
notes: |-
  * You can cancel a transfer job that is running in synchronous mode (foreground priority) by pressing CTRL+C.
inputs:
- name: <xref href="Microsoft.BackgroundIntelligentTransfer.Management.BitsJob" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  description: |-
    This cmdlet accepts one or more **BitsJob** objects as input that populates the *BitsJob* parameter.
outputs:
- name: <xref href="Microsoft.BackgroundIntelligentTransfer.Management.BitsJob" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  description: |-
    When called with the *Asynchronous* parameter, this cmdlet sends the **BitsJob** object that is associated with the resumed BITS transfer job as output.
    Otherwise, no output is generated.

examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Resume all BITS transfer jobs owned by the current user'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Get-BitsTransfer | Resume-BitsTransfer
  description: |-
    This command resumes all the BITS transfer jobs that are owned by the current user.

    The command prompt returns after the jobs are complete or after the jobs enter an error state.
    The output of the **Get-BitsTransfer** cmdlet is a set of BitsJob objects.
    This output is piped to the **Resume-BitsTransfer** cmdlet.
    If any of the BITS transfer jobs are already active, they will continue to run.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 2: Resume a new BITS transfer job that was initially suspended'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> $Bits = Start-BitsTransfer -DisplayName "MyJob" -Suspended
    PS C:\> Add-BitsTransfer -BitsJob $Bits  -ClientFileName C:\myFile -ServerFileName http://www.mysite.com/file1
    PS C:\> Resume-BitsTransfer -BitsJob $Bits -Asynchronous
  description: |-
    This command resumes a new BITS transfer job that was initially suspended, and it returns the command prompt immediately.

    The first command creates a new **BitsJob** object in a suspended state and then stores it in the $Bits variable.

    The second command adds a file to the transfer queue of the new **BitsJob** object that is stored in the $Bits variable.

    The third command uses the **BitsJob** parameter to pass the **BitsJob** object that is stored in the $Bits variable to the **Resume-BitsTransfer** cmdlet.
    This command starts the BITS transfer job.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 3: Resume the BITS transfer by the specified display name'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Get-BitsTransfer -Name "TestJob01" | Resume-BitsTransfer
  description: |-
    This command resumes the BITS transfer that is identified by the display name named TestJob01.

    The command prompt returns after the job is complete or after the job enters an error state.
    The output of the **Get-BitsTransfer** cmdlet is a **BitsJob** object.
    This output is piped to the **Resume-BitsTransfer** cmdlet.
    If the BITS transfer job is already active, it continues to run.
  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Asynchronous
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet processes the BITS transfer job in the background.
    The command prompt reappears immediately after the BITS transfer job is resumed.
    The returned **BitsJob** object can be used to monitor status and progress.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="BitsJob" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: BitsJob
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of BITS transfer jobs to resume.
    You can pipe a value to this parameter from other cmdlets that return **BitsJob** objects, such as the **Get-BitsTransfer** cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"

uid: BitsTransfer.Resume-BitsTransfer
name: Resume-BitsTransfer
description: |-
  The **Resume-BitsTransfer** cmdlet resumes one or more suspended Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) transfer jobs.
  If the BITS transfer is already in process, the cmdlet does nothing.
  You can view the current state of a transfer job through the **Get-BitsTransfer** cmdlet.

  By default, the **Resume-BitsTransfer** cmdlet restarts the transfer job synchronously even if the original job was specified as an asynchronous transfer job.
  You could use this behavior to convert an asynchronous transfer job into a synchronous transfer job.
  You could do this if either of the following conditions is true:

  - The asynchronous transfer job was created outside cmdlets.

  - The asynchronous transfer job was created through the **Start-BitsTransfer** cmdlet.

  If you want to restart the transfer job as an asynchronous transfer, use the *Asynchronous* parameter.
