  code: |-
    PS C:\> $Bits = Get-BitsTransfer -JobId 10778CFA-C1D7-4A82-8A9D-80B19224879C
    PS C:\> Set-BitsTransfer -BitsJob $Bits -Priority High
  description: |-
    This command modifies the priority of an existing BITS transfer job.

    The first command retrieves the BITS transfer job specified by the *JobId* parameter and then stores it in the $Bits variable.

    The second command uses the *BitsJob*parameter to pass the **BitsJob** object stored in the $Bits variable to the **Set-BitsTransfer** cmdlet.
    The *Priority* parameter is used to set the priority of the BITS transfer job to High.

  code: |-
    PS C:\> Get-BitsTransfer -AllUsers -Name *Microsoft* | Set-BitsTransfer -SetOwnerToCurrentUser
  description: |-
    This command makes the current user the owner of a set of existing BITS transfer jobs.

    The output of the **Get-BitsTransfer** cmdlet is a set of **BitsJob** objects whose display name contains Microsoft.
    This output is passed to the **Set-BitsTransfer** cmdlet through the pipeline.
    The *SetOwnerToCurrentUser* parameter specifies that the owner of each BITS transfer job is the current user.

- title: 'Example 3: Modify the proxy settings of a BITS transfer job'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> $Bits = Get-BitsTransfer -JobId 10778CFA-C1D7-4A82-8A9D-80B19224879C
    PS C:\> $Cred = Get-Credential
    PS C:\> Set-BitsTransfer -BitsJob $Bits -ProxyUsage AutoDetect -ProxyAuthentication $Cred
  description: |-
    This command modifies the proxy settings of an existing BITS transfer job.

    The first command retrieves the BITS transfer job identified by the *JobId* parameter and then stores it in the variable named $Bits.

    The second command retrieves credentials from the user and then stores them in the $Cred variable.

    The third command uses the *BitsJob* parameter to pass the **BitsJob** object stored in the $Bits variable to the **Set-BitsTransfer** cmdlet.
    It uses the *ProxyAuthentication* parameter to pass the **PSCredential** object stored in the $Cred variable.
    The *ProxyUsage* parameter allows the BITS transfer job to automatically discover the Web proxy server by using the Web Proxy Autodiscovery Protocol (WPAD) protocol.
    The supplied set of credentials is used to authenticate the user at the proxy server.

- title: 'Example 4: Modify the proxy settings of a BITS transfer job using a proxy list and proxy bypass'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Get-BitsTransfer | Set-BitsTransfer -ProxyUsage Override -ProxyList "http://proxy1", "http://proxy2:81" -ProxyBypass "http://directconnect"
  description: |-
    This command modifies the proxy settings of an existing BITS transfer job.

    The output of the **Get-BitsTransfer** cmdlet is the set of **BitsJob** objects that are owned by the current user.
    This output is piped to the **Set-BitsTransfer** cmdlet.
    The Override value that is specified in the *ProxyUsage* parameter indicates that an explicit list of proxy server and bypassed host names are provided.

    The *ProxyList* parameter specifies two proxy servers.
    The first server in the list (`http://proxy1`) is used.
    If that connection fails, the command tries the connection by using the second server in the list (`http://proxy2:81`).
    If both connections fail, the job fails.

    When a list of host names is specified in the *ProxyBypass* parameter, the connection that is made is a direct connection that does not use a proxy server.
    In this example, no proxy server is used to add a file to the BITS transfer queue on the directconnect server.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Authentication
  description: |+
    Specifies the authentication mechanism to be used at the server.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - **Basic**: Basic is a scheme in which the user name and password are sent in clear text to the server or proxy.

    - **Digest**: Digest is a challenge-response scheme that uses a server-specified data string for the challenge.

    - **NTLM**: NT LAN Manager (NTLM) is a challenge-response scheme that uses the credentials of the user for authentication in a Windows-based network environment.

    - **Negotiate** (the default): Negotiate is a challenge-response scheme that negotiates with the server or proxy to determine which scheme to use for authentication. For example, this parameter value allows negotiation to determine whether the Kerberos protocol or NTLM is used.

    - **Passport**: Passport is a centralized authentication service provided by Microsoft that offers a single logon for member sites.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Credential
  description: |+
    Specifies the credentials to use to authenticate the user at the server.
    The default is the current user.
    Type a user name, such as "User01", "Domain01\User01", or "User@Contoso.com".
    Or, use the **Get-Credential** cmdlet to create the value for this parameter.
    When you type a user name, you are prompted for a password.

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Priority
  description: |+
    Specifies the priority of the BITS transfer job, which affects bandwidth usage.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - **Foreground** (default): Transfers the job in the foreground. Foreground transfers compete for network bandwidth with other applications, which can impede the user's overall network experience. However, if the **Start-BitsTransfer** cmdlet is being used interactively, this is likely the best option. This is the highest priority level.

    - **High**: Transfers the job in the background with a high priority. Background transfers use the idle network bandwidth of the client computer to transfer files.

    - **Normal**: Transfers the job in the background with a normal priority. Background transfers use the idle network bandwidth of the client computer to transfer files.

    - **Low**: Transfers the job in the background with a low priority. Background transfers use the idle network bandwidth of the client to transfer files. This is the lowest background priority level.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: p
  parameterValueGroup: Foreground, High, Normal, Low
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ProxyAuthentication
  description: |+
    Specifies the authentication mechanism to use at the Web proxy.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - **Basic**: Basic is a scheme in which the user name and password are sent in clear text to the server or proxy.

    - **Digest**: Digest is a challenge-response scheme that uses a server-specified data string for the challenge.

    - **NTLM**: NTLM is a challenge-response scheme that uses the credentials of the user for authentication in a Windows-based network environment.

    - **Negotiate** (the default): Negotiate is a challenge-response scheme that negotiates with the server or proxy to determine which scheme to use for authentication. For instance, this parameter value allows negotiation to determine whether the Kerberos protocol or NTLM is used.

  name: ProxyBypass
  description: |+
    Specifies a list of host names to use for a direct connection.
    The hosts in the list are tried in order until a successful connection is achieved.
    If you specify this parameter the cmdlet bypasses the proxy.
    If this parameter is used, the *ProxyUsage* parameter must be set to **Override**; otherwise, an error occurs.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: pb
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ProxyCredential
  description: |+

  name: ProxyList
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of proxies to use.
    The proxies in the list are tried in order until a successful connection is achieved.
    If this parameter is specified and *ProxyUsage* is set to a value other than **Override**, an error occurs.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: pl
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ProxyUsage
  description: |+
    Specifies the proxy usage settings.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - **SystemDefault** (the default): Use the system default proxy settings.

    - **NoProxy**: Do not use a proxy to transfer the files. Use this option when you transfer files within a local area network (LAN).

    - **AutoDetect**: Automatically detect proxy settings. BITS detects proxy settings for each file in the job.

    - **Override**: Specify the proxies or servers to use. If the *ProxyList* parameter is also specified, the proxies in that list are used. If the *ProxyBypass* parameter is also specified, the servers in that list are used. In both cases, the first member of the list is used. If the first member is unreachable, the subsequent members are tried until a member is contacted successfully.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: SystemDefault, NoProxy, AutoDetect, Override
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RetryInterval
  description: |+
    Specifies the minimum length of time, in seconds, that BITS waits before it attempts to transfer the file after BITS encounters a transient error.
    The minimum allowed value is 60 seconds.
    If this value exceeds the RetryTimeout value from the **BitsJob** object, BITS will not retry the transfer.
    Instead, BITS sets the state of the BITS transfer job to the Error state.

    The default is 600 seconds (10 minutes).

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RetryTimeout
  description: |+
    Specifies the length of time, in seconds, that BITS attempts to transfer the file after the first transient error occurs.
    Setting the retry period to 0 prevents retries.
    If the retry period value exceeds the JobInactivityTimeout Group Policy setting (90-day default), BITS cancels the job.

    The default value is 1,209,600 seconds (14 days).

  defaultValue: None

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: so
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CostStates" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: TransferPolicy
  description: |+
    Specifies the network cost states in which the transfer is allowed to be scheduled.
    The current cost state of the network is a bitmask that indicates the kinds of charges that would be incurred if a transfer was scheduled at this time.
    This cost state represents a bitmask; if the bit corresponding to the current network cost state is set, the transfer can be scheduled.
    If the bit corresponding to the current network cost state is not set, the transfer is ignored for scheduling purposes.
    You can submit any of the named values listed here, or add them together to provide a custom value.

    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - **Unrestricted** (or unknown) : 0x00000001 : the cost state for this network is not known.

    - **Capped** : 0x00000002 : the cost state for this network is a capped plan, or a plan that has a data usage limit.

    - **BelowCap** : 0x00000004 : the cost state for this network is below the data plan cap.

    - **NearCap** : 0x00000008 : the cost state for this network is near the data plan cap.

    - **OverCapCharged** : 0x00000010 : the cost state for this network is above the data plan cap, and such usage is charged.

    - **OverCapThrottled** : 0x00000020 : the cost state for this network is above the data plan cap, and such usage is throttled.

    - **UsageBased** : 0x00000040 : the cost state for this network is charged based on usage.

    - **Roaming** : 0x00000080 : the cost state for this network incurs roaming charges. 

    The cost state also includes one option (IgnoreCongestion) and a set of standard policies (Uncosted, Standard, NoSurcharge, NotRoaming, and Always) which are combinations of the discrete bit values.

    - **IgnoreCongestion** : 0x80000000 : the job can be scheduled even if the network provider reports that the network is congested.

    - **PolicyUnrestricted** : 0x80000021 : the set of cost states that do not consume the quota of a capped plan, or incur extra charges.

    - **Standard** : 0x80000067 : a set of cost states suitable for moderate-priority transfers.

    - **NoSurcharge** : 0x8000006f : the set of cost states that incur no surcharge for use.

    - **NotRoaming** : 0x8000007f : the set of cost states that exclude the roaming state.

    - **Always** : 0x800000ff : the set of all cost states.

    The default value is determined by a combination of job priority and group policy. 
    If this value is not explicitly set, it can vary when job priority or current group policy are modified.

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="AuthenticationTargetValue" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: UseStoredCredential
  description: |+
    Specifies that credentials stored in the Windows Credential Manager should be used for authentication when required for the specified target server type.
    If this parameter is not specified and a server requires authentication, then explicit credentials must be included by using the *Credential* or *ProxyCredential* parameters.
    This parameter is a flag parameter whose values can be added together to create the desired behavior.

    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - **None**: Use only credentials provided by the *Credential* or *ProxyCredential* parameters. This is the default behavior if the parameter is not specified.

    - **Proxy**: Credentials stored in the Windows Credential Manager are used for authentication for any proxy server that requires authentication. If no credentials in the Windows Credential Manager match the proxy server needing authentication, then you must specify credentials by using the *ProxyCredential* parameter.

    - **Server**: This value is not supported and generates an error if specified.
