  code: |-
    PS C:\> Get-BitsTransfer | Suspend-BitsTransfer
  description: |-
    This command suspends all the BITS transfer jobs that are owned by the current user.

    The output of **Get-BitsTransfer** is a set of **BitsJob** objects.

- title: 'Example 2: Suspend all BITS transfer jobs on the computer'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> $Bits = Get-BitsTransfer -AllUsers
    PS C:\> Suspend-BitsTransfer -BitsJob $Bits
  description: |-
    This command suspends all the BITS transfer jobs on the computer.

    The first command gets all the **BitsJob** objects on the computer and then stores them in the $Bits variable.

    The second command uses the *BitsJob* parameter to pass the **BitsJob** objects that are stored in the $Bits variable to the **Suspend-BitsTransfer** cmdlet.
