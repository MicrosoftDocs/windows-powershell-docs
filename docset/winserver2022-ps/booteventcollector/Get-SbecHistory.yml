module: BootEventCollector
notes: ""
inputs:
- name: <xref href="None." data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: ""
outputs:
- name: <xref href="CIM/WMI objects of class \Root\Microsoft\Windows\BootEventCollector\TargetForwardingHistory" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    The CIM/WMI objects contain the following fields

    - `<TargetEndpoint>`: The target computer's endpoint information in human-readable format, as its host:port string (for example, 127.0.0.1:50000). 
    - `<TargetMac>`: The target computer's MAC address (if known). 
    - `<TargetGuid>`: The target computer's SMBIOS GUID (if known). 
    - `<CollectorEndpoint>`: The host:port information of the endpoint on the collector side. 
    - `<Computer>`: Target computer name, as determined by the collector according to its configuration. 
    - `<ForwarderType>`: Type of the forwarder (such as 'etl'). 
    - `<Destination>`: Destination of the data.
    The meaning depends on the forwarder type.
    A file name (such as for the ETL forwarder), or some other identification. 
    - `<DestinationPattern>`: Pattern used to generate the destination of the data.
    The meaning depends on the forwarder type and configuration.
    For a fixed destination, would be the same as the destination itself.
    For the destination with rotation of the files would contain the pattern characters that will be replaced with the actual index in the destination. 
    - `<Error>`: Error message if an error was encountered.
    Otherwise will be empty.`<ConnectedSince>`: CIM timestamp of when the connection was established. 
    - `<DisconnectedSince>`: CIM timestamp of when the connection was dropped. 
    - `<WmiDateTime>`: CIM timestamp of when this state change was recorded.

    Runs the cmdlet on the remote computers through a remote session.
    Enter a session object, such as the output of a **New-CimSession** or **Get-CimSession** cmdlet, or an array of these objects.
    The default is to run the cmdlet on the local computer.
    For more information, see About_CimSession.

    Specifies the names of the computers on which you want to perform the operation.
    You can specify a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), a NetBIOS name, or an IP address for each computer.

description: |-
  The **Get-SbecHistory** cmdlet gets the recent history of changes in connection status from the Setup and Boot Event Collector.

  The length of the history kept in the Collector and returned by this command is limited by an absolute number.
  After the history grows beyond this size, new events cause the older events to disappear.
  Because of this, the returned history is not full but only recent.
  Reading the history doesn't erase it.

  The similar information, in a reduced form, can be written by the Collector into the status log file.
  The reduction is in the sense that the status log only shows the points when a new ETL file is opened for a connection.
  The information from the status log file can be obtained with **Get-SbecDestination**.
