  The **Save-SbecInstance** cmdlet writes the in-memory buffers of the running Setup and Boot Event Collector to disk.

  When the command returns, the buffers of the forwarders in the Setup and Boot Event Collector are saved to disk, and thus all the data up to the point when the write request was received is saved to disk.

  You must have the Builtin Administrator privilege to run this cmdlet.

  The alias for this cmdlet is **Flush-SbecInstance**.
