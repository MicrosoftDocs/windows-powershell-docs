parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 

    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt. 
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes. 
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets. 
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Disable
  description: |+
    Indicates that the server disables the data deduplication schedule immediately after you create it.
    The server does not run the data deduplication schedule at the time that you specify in the **Start** parameter.
    After you disable a data deduplication schedule, you can use the **Set-DedupSchedule** cmdlet to enable the schedule.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DurationHours
  description: |+
    Specifies the number of hours that the server runs the task before canceling it.
    The value 0 indicates that the server runs the job to completion.
    This cmdlet safely stops a data deduplication job and does not affect the files that the server is processing when it cancels the job.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Full
  description: |+
    Indicates that garbage collection jobs free up all deleted or unreferenced data on the volume, if you specify the value GarbageCollection for the **Type** parameter.
    If you do not specify this parameter, garbage collection jobs free up space after a system threshold of delete data is exceeded.
    We recommend that you run garbage collection regularly without specifying this parameter, and then once a month specify this parameter and run garbage collection again.

    If you specify the value Scrubbing for the **Type** parameter, this parameter   indicates that scrubbing jobs validate the integrity of all data on the volume.
    If you do not specify this parameter, the scrubbing job validates only critical metadata and data integrity issues that data deduplication previously encountered.
    We recommend that you run scrubbing regularly without specifying this parameter, and then once a month specify this parameter and run scrubbing again.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: InputOutputThrottle
  description: |+
    Specifies the amount of input/output throttling applied to the deduplication job.
    Throttling ensures that deduplication does not interfere with other I/O intensive processes.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are: integers from 0 to 100.
    If you specify this parameter and the **InputOutputThrottleLevel** parameter, **InputOutputThrottle** takes precedence.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="InputOutputThrottleLevel" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: InputOutputThrottleLevel
  description: |+
    Specifies the amount of I/O throttling that the job provides to ensure that the job does not interfere with other I/O intensive processes.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - None
    - Low
    - Medium
    - High

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: None, Low, Medium, High, Maximum
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Memory
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum percentage of physical computer memory that the data deduplication job can use.

    For optimization jobs, we recommend that you set a range from 15 to 50, and a higher memory consumption for jobs that you schedule to run when you specify the **StopWhenSystemBusy** parameter.
    For garbage collection and scrubbing jobs, which you typically schedule to run in off hours, you can set a higher memory consumption, such as 50.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: MaximumMemoryPercentage
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />

    Specifies a name for the data deduplication job schedule.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Priority" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Priority
  description: |+
    Sets the CPU and I/O priority for the optimization job that you run by using this cmdlet.
    For jobs that you run when you specify the **StopWhenSystemBusy** parameter, we recommend that you set this parameter to Low.
    For typical optimization jobs, we recommend that you set this parameter to Normal.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="DateTime" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Start
  description: |+
    Specifies a time to start this job.
    The default value is 1:45am.

    Type the date in a format that is standard for the system locale, such as dd-MM-yyyy (German \[Germany\]) or MM/dd/yyyy (English \[United States\]).

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: StopWhenSystemBusy
  description: |+
    Indicates that the server stops the job when the system is busy and retries later.
    We recommend that you specify this parameter when you set a low priority for the job.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None

  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Type" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Type
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the type of data deduplication job.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Optimization
    - GarbageCollection
    - Scrubbing
    - Unoptimization

  defaultValue: None

uid: Deduplication.New-DedupSchedule
name: New-DedupSchedule
description: |-
  The **New-DedupSchedule** cmdlet creates a data deduplication schedule.
  This cmdlet returns a **DeduplicationSchedule** object that you can use to customize the data deduplication schedule.
  This cmdlet uses default settings to create a data deduplication schedule for the parameters that you do not specify.

  You can create a schedule to run the following types data deduplication jobs:

  - Optimization. 
  This job performs both deduplication and compression of files according data deduplication policy for the volume. 
  After initial optimization of a file, if that file is then modified and again meets the data deduplication policy threshold for optimization, the file is optimized again. 
  - GarbageCollection. 
  This job processes deleted or modified data on the volume so that any data chunks that are no longer referenced are cleaned up. 
  Garbage collection jobs process previously deleted or logically overwritten optimized content to create usable volume free space. 
  When an optimized file is deleted or overwritten by new data, the old data in the chunk store is not immediately deleted. 
  Garbage collection is scheduled to run weekly by default. Garbage collection is a processing-intensive operation, so you should allow the deletion load to reach a threshold and then manually run this job type, or schedule it for off hours.
  - Scrubbing. 
  This job processes data corruptions it finds during data integrity validation, performs possible corruption repair, and generates a scrubbing report. 
  - Unoptimization. 
  This job undoes data deduplication on all of the optimized files on the volume. 
  At the end of a successful unoptimization job, the server deletes all of the data deduplication metadata from the volume.
