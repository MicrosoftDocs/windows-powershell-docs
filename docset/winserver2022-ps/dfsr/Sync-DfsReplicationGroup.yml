  position: "1"
  aliases: SendingMember, SMem
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

description: |-
  The **Sync-DfsReplicationGroup** cmdlet synchronizes replication between a source computer and a destination computer, even if replication is not scheduled by either a replication group or a connection.

  This cmdlet ignores the schedule for the specified number of minutes.
  Use this cmdlet to alter the schedule temporarily to allow replication, because this cmdlet does not require Active Directory replication and LDAP polling.
