parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job.
    Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 
    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt.
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes.
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets.
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 
    For more information about Windows PowerShell® background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

description: |-
  The **Remove-DhcpServerv4Lease** cmdlet deletes one or more IPv4 lease records from the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server service.

  If you specify the *ScopeId* parameter, all of the leases for the specified scope are deleted.

  If you specify the *IPAddress* parameter, the leases for clients identified by one or more specified IP addresses are deleted.
  If you specify the *ClientId* and the *ScopeId* parameters, the lease for the specified client identifier (ID) from the specified scope is deleted.

  If you specify the *BadLeases* and the *ScopeId* parameters, this cmdlet removes all of the bad lease records for the specified scope.

  If you specify the *BadLeases* parameter without the *ScopeId* parameter, this cmdlet removes all of the bad leases from all of the scopes on the DHCP server service.
