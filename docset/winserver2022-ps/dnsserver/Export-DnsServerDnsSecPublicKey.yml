    Exporting a trust anchor without using authentication is insecure unless DNSSEC is active on "${ComputerName}", a trust anchor covering "${ZoneName}" is installed, and the connection between the local machine and "${ComputerName}" is secure. Consider alternative means of exporting the trust anchors, such as the DNSCMD protocol, email, or HTTPS. Proceed?

    This command exports the trust anchor (DS record) for Contoso.com to a file share.
    A DNS administrator runs this command from the DNS server that hosts the zone Contoso.com and specifies that the zone signing key uses the SHA-1 algorithm to create the DS record.

    This command creates Dsset-Contoso.com in \\\\MyDNSKeyShare\keys and writes the DS record in the Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure.CimInstance#root/Microsoft/Windows/DNS/DNS/DnsServerResourceRecord format.

    This command exports a trust anchor (DNSKEY record) for Contoso.com to a file share.
    The DNS administrator who runs this command has no permissions to the DNS server that hosts the zone Contoso.com.
    This command specifies that the zone signing key uses the SHA-1 algorithm to create the DS record.

    This command creates Keyset-Contoso.com in \\\\MyDNSKeyShare\keys and writes the DS record in the Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure.CimInstance#root/Microsoft/Windows/DNS/DNS/DnsServerResourceRecord format.

- title: 'Example 3: Get the trust anchors for all the signed zones'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Get-DnsServerZone | ForEach-Object {Export-DnsServerDnsSecPublicKey -ComputerName "DNSDC1.Contoso.com" -ZoneName "Contoso.com" -Path "\\MyDNSKeyShare\keys" -PassThru -UnAuthorized -Force  }
  description: |-
    This command gets the trust anchors for all the signed zones that are hosted on the DNS server Contoso.com.
    In this scenario the DNS Server is currently hosting signed zones for contoso.com, dinnernow.com and hrweb.net

    The command uses a **ForEach-Object** cmdlet to export the trust anchors and pass the results to the **Get-DnsServerZone** cmdlet by using the pipeline operator.

    This command creates a keyset file in the share for each signed zone that is hosted on the DNS server (Keyset-Contoso.com, Keyset-Dinnernow.com, Keyset-Hrweb.net) and writes the DNSKEY record in the Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure.CimInstance#root/Microsoft/Windows/DNS/DNS/DnsServerResourceRecord format.

- title: 'Example 4: Import a trust anchor to a non-authorized DN server'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> $publicKey = Export-DnsServerDnssecPublicKey -ZoneName "contoso.com" -Path "C:\" -PassThru -UnAuthenticated -Force
    PS C:\> $publicKey[0].RecordData | Add-DnsServerTrustAnchor -Name "constoso.com" -ComputerName "DNSDC1.Contoso.com"
  description: |-
    The first command exports the trust anchor (DNSKEY record) for Contoso.com to the specified path, and stores the results in the **$publicKey** variable.
    The *UnAuthenticated* parameter indicates that the DNS administrator who runs this command has no permissions to the DNS server that hosts the zone Contoso.com.

    The second command adds the first trust record that was exported from Contoso.com into a non-authoritative DNS server named DNSDC1.Contoso.com.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 

    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt. 
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes. 
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets. 
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).
