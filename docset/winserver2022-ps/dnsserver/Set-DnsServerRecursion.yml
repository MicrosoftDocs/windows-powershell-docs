parameters:
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AdditionalTimeout
  description: |+
    Specifies the time interval, in seconds, that a DNS server waits as it uses recursion to get resource records from a remote DNS server.
    We recommend that you limit the value to the range 0x00000000 to 0x0000000F (0 seconds to 15 seconds), inclusive.
    However, you can use any value.
    We recommend that you set the default value to 4.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 

    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt. 
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes. 
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets. 
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimSession" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ComputerName
  description: |+
    Specifies a DNS server.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are: an IPv4 address; an IPv6 address; and any other value that resolves to an IP address, such as a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), host name, or NETBIOS name.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Cn
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Enable
  description: |+
    Specifies whether the server enables recursion.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: EnableRecursion
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PassThru
  description: |+
    Returns an object representing the item with which you are working.
    By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RetryInterval
  description: |+
    Specifies elapsed seconds before a DNS server retries a recursive lookup.
    If the parameter is undefined or zero, the DNS server retries after three seconds.
    Valid values are in the range of 1 second to 15 seconds.

    We recommend that in general, you do not change the value of this parameter.
    However, under a few circumstances you should consider changing the parameter value.
    For example, if a DNS server contacts a remote DNS server over a slow link and retries the lookup before it gets a response, you can raise the retry interval to be slightly longer than the observed response time.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SecureResponse
  description: |+
    Indicates whether a DNS server screens DNS records against the zone of authority for the remote server, to prevent cache pollution.
    If you set this to $True, the DNS server caches only those records that are in the zone of authority for the queried remote server.
    Otherwise, the server caches all records in the remote server cache.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Timeout
  description: |+
    Specifies the number of seconds that a DNS server waits before it stops trying to contact a remote server.
    The valid value is in the range of 0x1 to 0xFFFFFFFF (1 second to 15 seconds).
    The default setting is 0xF (15 seconds).
    We recommend that you increase this value when recursion occurs over a slow link.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: wi
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: DnsServer.Set-DnsServerRecursion
name: Set-DnsServerRecursion
description: |-
  The **Set-DnsServerRecursion** cmdlet modifies recursion settings for a Domain Name System (DNS) server.
  Recursion occurs when a DNS server queries other DNS servers on behalf of a requesting client, and then sends the answer back to the client.
