    This example gets information about each of the clusters in the `contoso.com` domain.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 4
  code: |-
    Get-Cluster | ForEach-Object -Process {$_.CrossSubnetDelay = 1500}
  description: |-
    This example sets the common property called `CrossSubnetDelay` for the local cluster to `1500`.

  code: |-
    Get-Cluster | Format-List -Property Quarantine*
  description: |-
    This example shows default values for **QuarantineThreshold** and **QuarantineDuration** for the
    local cluster.

    - **QuarantineThreshold**: This is the number of times that a node can become isolated in an hour
     before the cluster will be quarantined. This is set to 3 by default.
    - **QuarantineDuration**: This setting, set to 7200 seconds or 2 hours by default, controls how long
      a host will remain quarantined.

  code: |-
    (Get-Cluster).MaximumParallelMigrations = 2
  description: |-
    Beginning with the 2022-09 Cumulative Update, you can now configure the number of parallel live
    migrations within a cluster. For more information, see
    [KB5017381](https://support.microsoft.com/help/5017381) for Windows Server 2022 and
    [KB5017382](https://support.microsoft.com/help/5017382) for Azure Stack HCI, version 21H2.

    This example sets the cluster property MaximumParallelMigrations to a value of `2`, limiting the
    number of live migrations that a cluster node can participate in. Both existing and new cluster
    nodes inherit this value of `2` because it's a cluster property. Setting the cluster
    property overrides any values configured using the [Set-VMHost](../hyper-v/Set-VMHost.yml)
    command.

  The `Get-Cluster` cmdlet gets information about one or more failover clusters in a given domain.

  This cmdlet can obtain a variety of configuration and state information about a failover cluster,
  including the following items:

  - State information about whether a backup is in progress.
  - State information about whether the cluster is in a forced quorum state.
  - Cross-network settings that are especially relevant for multi-site clusters.

  To set a common property for the cluster, use this cmdlet to get the cluster object and then set the
  appropriate property on that cluster object directly.
