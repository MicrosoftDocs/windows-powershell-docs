parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 

    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt. 
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes. 
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets. 
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

description: |-
  **The New-FsrmFileScreenException** cmdlet creates a file screen exception.
  A file screen exception is a special type of file screen that overrides any file screening that would otherwise apply to a folder, and all its subfolders, in a designated exception path.

  A file screen exception creates an exception to any rules derived from a parent folder.
  To determine which file types the exception allows, you can specify file groups for a file screen exception.

  You cannot create a file screen exception on a folder for which you already have a file screen.
  You must assign the exception to a subfolder or make changes to the existing file screen.
