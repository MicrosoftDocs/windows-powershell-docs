examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Set classification to run continuously'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Set-FsrmClassification -Continuous -ContinuousLog
  description: |-
    This command sets classification to run continuously and enables the continuous classification log.
    If you have not previously created a classification schedule, the command results in an error.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 2: Set the schedule for classification'
  code: |-
    The first command gets a **DateTime** object and stores it in the variable $D.
    PS C:\> $D = Get-Date "12:00am"

    The second command creates a **FsrmScheduledTask** object that defines a schedule for the task of once a month on the first day of the month at midnight. The command stores the **FsrmScheduledTask** object in the $Task variable.
    PS C:\> $Task = New-FsrmScheduledTask -Time $D.ToFileTimeUtc() -Monthly 1

    The third command sets the schedule for classification to the schedule stored in the $Task variable.
    PS C:\> Set-FsrmClassification -Schedule $Task
  description: |-
    This example sets the schedule for classification to run once a month on the first day at midnight.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 

    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt. 
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes. 
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets. 
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

- type: <xref href="CimSession" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Continuous
  description: |+
    Indicates that the server continuously applies classification to files in the background.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ContinuousLog
  description: |+
    Indicates that the server maintains a log of continuous classification activities.
    You must specify the *Continuous* parameter to log classification activities.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt64" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ContinuousLogSize
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum size of the log that contains continuous classification activity.
    You must specify the *Continuous* parameter to log classification activities.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: ExcludeNamespace
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of strings that contain the list of folders to not include in classification (scheduled or continuous).

    You can include \[AllVolumes\] in each folder at the start of a path to indicate that the namespace is excluded on all volumes.
    You can append the string /s to each namespace to exclude all folders and files in that namespace.
    If /s is not appended to the namespace, only the files in the specified folder are excluded.
    If one string is \[Default\], the server adds the default values to the exclude namespaces.
    The boot volume is always excluded regardless of this value.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimInstance" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: InputObject
  description: |+
    Specifies the input to this cmdlet. 
    You can use this parameter, or you can pipe the input to this cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PassThru
  description: |+
    Returns an object representing the item with which you are working.
    By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimInstance" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Schedule
  description: |+
    Specifies a File Server Resource Manager (FSRM) scheduled task object that describes the schedule for performing the continuous classification.
    Use the **New-FsrmScheduledTask** cmdlet to create a scheduled task object.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.
