examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Wait for a classification'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Start-FsrmClassification
    PS C:\> Wait-FsrmClassification
  description: |-
    The first command starts the classification.

    The second command waits for the classification to finish running.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 2: Wait for and stop the classification'
  code: |-
    The first command starts the classification process.
    PS C:\> Start-FsrmClassification

    The second command waits for the classification to finish running. If the classification is not completed in 10 minutes, the server ends the classification process and the cmdlet returns.
    PS C:\> Wait-FsrmClassification -Timeout 600

    The third command ensures that the classification has stopped running.
    PS C:\> Stop-FsrmClassification
  description: |-
    This example waits for the classification to finish running and then stops the classification.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 

    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt. 
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes. 
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets. 
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Timeout
  description: |+
    Specifies the number of seconds to wait for classification and the reports to complete.
    The cmdlet returns when the period expires or classification completes.
    To wait indefinitely, set the value to -1.
    The value must be in the range from -1 through 2,147,483.
