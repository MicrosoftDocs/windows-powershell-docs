examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Wait for a file management job to finish'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Start-FsrmFileManagementJob -Name "Expire stale data"
    PS C:\> Wait-FsrmFileManagementJob -Name "Expire stale data"
  description: |-
    This command waits for the file management job named "Expire stale data" to finish running.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 2: Wait for and stop a file management job'
  code: |-
    The first command starts the file management job named "Expire stale data".
    PS C:\> Start-FsrmFileManagementJob -Name "Expire stale data"

    The second command waits for the file management job to finish running. If the file management job is not completed in 10 minutes, the server ends the file management job and the cmdlet returns.
    PS C:\> Wait-FsrmFileManagementJob -Name "Expire stale data" -Timeout 600

    The third command ensures that the file management job has stopped running.
    PS C:\> Stop-FsrmFileManagementJob -Name "Expire stale data"
  description: |-
    This example waits for the file management job named "Expire stale data" to finish running and then stops the job.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 

    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt. 
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes. 
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets. 
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Timeout
  description: |+
    Specifies the number of seconds that the server waits for the file management job to complete.
    To wait indefinitely, set the value to -1.
    The value must be in the range from -1 through 2,147,483.
    If the server is not running the job or the value is set to 0, the cmdlet returns immediately.
