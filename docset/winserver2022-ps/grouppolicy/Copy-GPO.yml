### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Copies a GPO.
module: GroupPolicy
notes: |-
  * You can use the **Copy-GPO** cmdlet to copy a GPO within a domain or from one domain to another within the same forest.

    You can use the *SourceDomain* and *TargetDomain* parameters to explicitly specify the source domain or the target domain for this cmdlet.

    If you do not explicitly specify the domain, the cmdlet uses a default domain.
  The default domain is the domain that is used to access network resources by the security context under which the current session is running.
  This domain is typically the domain of the user that is running the session.
  For example, the domain of the user who started the session by opening Windows PowerShell from the Program Files menu, or the domain of a user that is specified in a runas command.
  However, computer startup and shutdown scripts run under the context of the LocalSystem account.
  The LocalSystem account is a built-in local account, and it accesses network resources under the context of the computer account.
  Therefore, when this cmdlet is run from a startup or shutdown script, the default domain is the domain to which the computer is joined.
inputs:
- name: <xref href="Microsoft.GroupPolicy.Gpo" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    The cmdlet takes a GPO as input.
    GPO objects that are piped into the cmdlet are used as the source GPO.
    Collections that contain GPOs from different domains are not supported.
outputs:
- name: <xref href="Microsoft.GroupPolicy.Gpo" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    This cmdlet outputs a copy of the specified GPO.

    This command copies the TestGpo1 GPO to a GPO named TestGpo2.
    The GPOs exist in the domain of the user that is running the session.
  summary: ""

  code: |-
    PS C:\> Copy-GPO -SourceName "TestGpo1" -SourceDomain "test.contoso.com" TargetName "TestGpo1" -TargetDomain "sales.contoso.com"
  description: |-
    This command copies the TestGpo1 GPO from the test.contoso.com domain to a GPO named TestGpo1 in the sales.contoso.com domain.

    A trust relationship must exist between the source domain and the destination domain.
    In addition, if the source domain or the destination domain (or both) is different than the domain of the user that is running the session.a trust must exist between that domain and the domain of the user.

- title: 'Example 3: Copy all GPOs from a domain to another domain'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Get-GPO -All -Domain "sales1.contoso.com" | ForEach-Object {$_ | Copy-GPO -TargetName ($_.DisplayName) -TargetDomain "sales2.contoso.com" -CopyAcl -MigrationTable "c:\tables\MigrationTable.migtable"}
  description: |-
    This command copies all the GPOs in the sales1.contoso.com domain to the sales2.contoso.com domain.

    All the GPOs in the source domain are retrieved by using the **Get-GPO** cmdlet using the *All* parameter.
    The output of **Get-GPO** is piped into the ForEach-Object command.
    When each GPO is evaluated, it is piped into **Copy-GPO** and its display name is specified for the *TargetName* parameter "-TargetName ($_.DisplayName)".
    The *CopyACL* parameter is specified to copy the ACLs for each GPO to the destination domain.
    The *MigrationTable* parameter specifies a migration table to use to migrate Security principals and UNC paths to the destination domain.
    Both the *CopyACL* and the *MigrationTable* parameters are optional.

    If a GPO with the same display name as a source GPO already exists in the destination domain, an error occurs when this command attempts to copy the source GPO.
    Because this command copies all GPOs in the source domain, errors occur for default GPOs; for instance, the Default Domain Policy GPO and the Default Domain Controllers Policy GPO.
    These GPOs are not copied.
    You can suppress these error messages by supplying the *ErrorAction* parameter with a value of SilentlyContinue to **Copy-GPO**.
    For more information about the *ErrorAction* parameter, see about_CommonParameters.

    The destination GPOs that were successfully copied are returned by this command.
    By default, they are printed to the display, but you can add commands to the end of the pipeline to further configure these GPOs.
    For example you can add a Set-GPLink cmdlet to the end of the pipeline to link all the destination GPOs to a site, domain, or organizational unit.

    A trust relationship must exist between the source domain and the destination domain.
    In addition, if the source domain or the destination domain (or both) is different than the domain of the user that is running the session a trust must exist between that domain and the domain of the user or the computer.

    You must specify the full path to the file; for instance, \\\\Server1\MigrationTables\TestToSalesTable.migtable.
    If you supply a migration table, security principals and Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths are mapped to the destination GPO when you copy a GPO across domains.

    If the cmdlet is being run from a computer startup or shutdown script, the domain of the computer is used.
    For more information, see the Notes section in the full Help.

    If you specify a domain that is different from the domain of the user that is running the current session (or, for a startup or shutdown script, the computer), a trust must exist between that domain and the domain of the user or the computer.

    You can also refer to the *SourceDomain* parameter by its built-in alias, domainname.

description: |-
  The **Copy-GPO** cmdlet creates a destination Group Policy Object (GPO) and copies the settings from the source GPO to the new GPO.
  The cmdlet can be used to copy a GPO from one domain to another domain within the same forest.
  You can specify a migration table to map security principals and paths when copying across domains.
  You can also specify whether to copy the access control list (ACL) from the source GPO to the destination GPO.

  This cmdlet does not copy the source GPO if a GPO with the specified target display name already exists in the destination domain.
  In this case, an error occurs and the GPO is not copied.
