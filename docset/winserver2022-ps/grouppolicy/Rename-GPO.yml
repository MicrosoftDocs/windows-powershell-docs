### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Assigns a new display name to a GPO.
module: GroupPolicy
notes: |-
  * You can use the *Domain* parameter to explicitly specify the domain for this cmdlet.

    If you do not explicitly specify the domain, the cmdlet uses a default domain.
  The default domain is the domain that is used to access network resources by the security context under which the current session is running.
  This domain is typically the domain of the user that is running the session.
  For example, the domain of the user who started the session by opening Windows PowerShell from the Program Files menu, or the domain of a user that is specified in a runas command.
  However, computer startup and shutdown scripts run under the context of the LocalSystem account.
  The LocalSystem account is a built-in local account, and it accesses network resources under the context of the computer account.
  Therefore, when this cmdlet is run from a startup or shutdown script, the default domain is the domain to which the computer is joined.

  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Domain
  description: |+
    Specifies the domain for this cmdlet.
    You must specify the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the domain.

    For the **Rename-GPO** cmdlet, this is the domain of the GPO that you want to rename.

    If you do not specify the *Domain* parameter, the domain of the user that is running the current session is used.
    If the cmdlet is being run from a computer startup or shutdown script, the domain of the computer is used.
    For more information, see the Notes section in the full Help.

    If you specify a domain that is different from the domain of the user that is running the current session (or, for a startup or shutdown script, the computer), a trust must exist between that domain and the domain of the user or the computer.

    You can also refer to the *Domain* parameter by its built-in alias, domainname.
    For more information, see about_Aliases.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: DomainName
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Guid" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Guid
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the GPO to rename by its globally unique identifier (GUID).
    The GUID uniquely identifies the GPO.

    You can also refer to the *Guid* parameter by its built-in alias, id.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: Id
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the GPO to rename by its current display name.

    The display name is not guaranteed to be unique in the domain.
    If another GPO with the same display name exists in the domain, an error occurs.
    You can use the *Guid* parameter to uniquely identify a GPO.

    You can also refer to the Name parameter by its built-in alias, displayname.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: DisplayName
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Server
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the domain controller that this cmdlet contacts to complete the operation.
    You can specify either the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or the host name.

    If you do not specify the name by using the *Server* parameter, the primary domain controller (PDC) emulator is contacted.

    You can also refer to the *Server* parameter by its built-in alias, dc.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: DC
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: TargetName
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the new display name of the GPO.
    Because the display name may not be unique, an error is returned if another GPO in the domain has the same display name.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: wi
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: GroupPolicy.Rename-GPO
name: Rename-GPO
description: |-
  The **Rename-GPO** cmdlet assigns a different, non-null display name to a Group Policy Object (GPO).
  This cmdlet has no effect on the GUID of the GPO.
