  code: |-
    PS C:\> Merge-HwCertTestCollectionFromXml -LiteralPath ("C:\Temp\BasicTest.xml", "C:\Temp\CertificationTest.xml") | Export-HwCertTestCollectionToXml -Output "C:\Temp\Merged.xml"
  description: |-
    This command merges the results in two test collection files and exports the test result information to an .xml file named Merged.xml.
    The command merges files named BasicTest.xml and CertificationTest.xml.
    The command then passes the merged results to the **Export-HwCertTestCollectionToXml** cmdlet by using the pipeline operator.
    That cmdlet exports the results.

  code: |-
    PS C:\> Get-ChildItem -Recurse "C:\Temp\*.xml" | Merge-HwCertTestCollectionFromXml | Export-HwCertTestCollectionToXml -Output "C:\Temp\Merged.xml"
  description: |-
    This command merges the results in all the test collection files in a specified folder and exports the merged test result information to an .xml file named Merged.xml.
    The command uses the **Get-ChildItem** cmdlet to get all the .xml files in the C:\Temp folder.
    For more information, type `Get-Help Get-ChildItem`.
    The command then passes the .xml files to the **Merge-HwCertTestCollectionFromXml** cmdlet by using the pipeline operator.
    That cmdlet merges the test results.
    Finally, the command passes the merged results to the **Export-HwCertTestCollectionToXml** cmdlet.
    That cmdlet exports the results.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: HckBuildVersion

    Specifies an HCK build version.
    This cmdlet merges the results that match this build version only.

  defaultValue: None

  name: LiteralPath
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of file paths.
    These are file paths to test collection .xml files.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ValidationXmlPath
  description: |+
    Specifies the path of a test collection .xml file to use for validation.
    The cmdlet checks the new test collection against the validation collection to ensure that at least one result exists.
    Validation helps to determine that all the tests merged from child lab collections meet the goals of the original test collection.

    To obtain a test collection file for validation, use the **New-HwCertTestCollection** cmdlet, along with the **Export-HwCertTestCollectionToXml** cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: XML

  The **Merge-HwCertTestCollectionFromXml** cmdlet merges test result information from several test collection .xml files into a single test collection.
  For more information, see [Windows Hardware Certification Kit downloads](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=614978) in the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) Library.

  You can use the **Export-HwCertTestCollectionToXml** cmdlet to export the merged test collection as an .xml file.
  You can use the **New-HwCertTestCollectionExcelReport** cmdlet to create a Microsoft Excel report of the test results.
