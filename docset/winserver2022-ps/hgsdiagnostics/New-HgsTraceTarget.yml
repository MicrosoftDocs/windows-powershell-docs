examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Create a default target object'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> New-HgsTraceTarget -Local
  description: |-
    This command creates a target object named localhost.
    Since this command does not specify a role, the cmdlet will use the credentials of the current session and then infers the role though the list of installed features on the target.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 2: Create a target with different credentials and a specified role'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> New-HgsTraceTarget -HostName "hgs-01.contoso.com" -Credential (Get-Credential) -Role HostGuardianService
  description: |-
    This command creates a target object with hostname named hgs-01.contoso.com that uses the provided credentials and makes the target a HGS node.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 3: Create a target to which no access is available with a specified role'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> New-HgsTraceTarget -HostName "hyperv-02.contoso.com" -NoAccess -Role GuardedHost
  description: |-
    This command creates a target object with hostname named hyperv-02.contoso.com that has no credentials but is regarded as a guarded host.
    No attempt will be made to connect to a NoAccess target.
  summary: ""
- title: "Example 4: Create a target that reuses the current session's credentials and a specified role"
  code: |-
    PS C:\> New-HgsTraceTarget -HostName "hgs-01.contoso.com" -role HostGuardianService
  description: |-
    This command creates a target object with hostname named hgs-01.contoso.com that reuses the credentials of the current session and makes the target a HGS node.
  summary: ""
- title: "Example 5: Create a target that reuses the current session's credentials and infer the role"
  code: |-
    PS C:\> New-HgsTraceTarget -HostName "hyperv-02.contoso.com"
  description: |-
    This command creates a target object with hostname hyperv-02.contoso.com that reuses the credentials of the current session and then infers the role though the list of installed features on the target.
