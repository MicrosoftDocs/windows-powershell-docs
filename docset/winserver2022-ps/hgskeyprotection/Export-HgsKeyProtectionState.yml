  The **Export-HgsKeyProtectionState** cmdlet exports configuration of Key Protection Service to a file referenced by the path parameter.
  If the path parameter is not provided, the cmdlet outputs the configuration state as XML.
  If the configuration contains certificates that were added to the service with pfx (containing private key), then the exported configuration also contains those private keys.
  The password parameter is used to protect the private keys that are part of the configuration.
  If the configuration contains certificates with private keys in Hardware Security Module (HSM), then the configuration only contains the public certificate.
