examples:
- title: Example 1
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Start-VMInitialReplication VM01
  description: |-
    This example starts initial replication of virtual machine VM01 over the network.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 2
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Start-VMInitialReplication *
  description: |-
    This example starts initial replication over the network for all the virtual machines on the local Hyper-V host for which initial replication is pending.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 3
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Start-VMInitialReplication * -DestinationPath R:\IRLoc
  description: |-
    This example exports the initial replication of all virtual machines on the local Hyper-V host for which initial replication is pending, to the location R:\IRLoc.
    This example assumes that the location is an external drive, which would be shipped to the Replica site so that the initial replication can be completed.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 4
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Enable-VMReplication VM01 -AsReplica -computername MyReplica.contoso.com
    PS C:\> Enable-VMReplication VMO1 -ReplicaServerName ReplicaServer01 -ReplicaServerPort 80 -AuthenticationType Kerberos -computername MyPrimary.contoso.comPS
    PS C:\> Start-VMInitialReplication VM01 -usebackup -computername MyPrimary.contoso.com
  description: |-
    This example uses several consecutive commands to start initial replication from backup.
    First, it enables a restored copy of virtual machine VM01 on the Replica server as a Replica virtual machine.
    Then, it enables replication for VM01 from the primary server.
    Finally, it starts the initial replication to use the restored copy of VM01 on Replica server as the basis of the initial replication.
  summary: ""
- title: Example 5
  code: |-
    PS C:\> $VMRepl = Get-VMReplication -VMName MyVM 
    PS C:\> Start-VMInitialReplication -VMReplication $VMRepl
  description: |-
    The first command returns a VMReplication object for the VM named MyVM and stores it in the variable $VMRepl.

    The second cmdlet then uses this object to start the initial replication for the stored VM.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimSession" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: ComputerName
  description: |+
    Specifies one or more Hyper-V hosts on which replication of a virtual machine is to be started.
    NetBIOS names, IP addresses, and fully qualified domain names are allowable.
    The default is the local computer.
    Use localhost or a dot (.) to specify the local computer explicitly.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Credential
  description: |+
    Specifies one or more user accounts that have permission to perform this action.
    The default is the current user.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DestinationPath
  description: |+
    Specifies the path to use when copying the files for initial replication; assumes use of external media as the method for initial replication.
    External media is typically a removable drive that is shipped to the location of the Replica server.
    When the external media arrives at the Replica site, use the **Import-InitialVMReplication** cmdlet on the Replica virtual machine to copy the files.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: IRLoc
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="DateTime" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: InitialReplicationStartTime
  description: |+
    Specifies the time to start the initial replication, when scheduling initial replication to occur later.
    You can specify a time up to 7 days later.
    When this parameter is not specified, initial replication occurs immediately.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: IRTime
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Passthru
  description: |+
    Specifies that a virtual machine object is to be passed through to the pipeline representing the virtual machine on which replication is to be started.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: UseBackup
