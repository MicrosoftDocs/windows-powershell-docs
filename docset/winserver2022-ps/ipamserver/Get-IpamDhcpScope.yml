examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Get information about all IPv4 scopes'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Get-IpamDhcpScope -AddressFamily "IPv4"
  description: |-
    This command returns all the IPv4 DHCP scopes found in the IPAM database.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 2: Get information about the IPv4 scopes on a specific server'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Get-IpamDhcpScope -AddressFamily "IPv4" -ServerFqdn "dhcp.contoso.com"
  description: |-
    This command also returns IPv4 DHCP scopes.
    In this case, however, the only scopes returned are the ones found on the server dhcp.contoso.com.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="AddressFamily" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: AddressFamily
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the address family for the DHCP scopes that this cmdlet gets.

    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - IPv4
    - IPv6

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: IPv4, IPv6
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 

    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt. 
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes. 
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets. 
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimSession" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="IPAddress" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: ScopeId
  description: |+
    Specifies the ID of the DHCP scope that this cmdlet gets.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "2"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: ServerFqdn
  description: |+
    Specifies the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the DHCP server hosting the DHCP scopes that this cmdlet gets.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "3"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None

uid: IpamServer.Get-IpamDhcpScope
name: Get-IpamDhcpScope
description: |-
  The **Get-IpamDhcpScope** cmdlet retrieves information about the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) scopes in the IP Address Management (IPAM) database.
  Scopes represent the IP addresses that a DHCP server can lease to clients.
  In most cases, scopes correspond to IP subnets.

  As a general rule, DHCP servers can only lease addresses from a single scope.
  However, superscopes provide a mechanism that allows a DHCP server to lease addresses from multiple scopes.
  See the **Get-IpamDhcpSuperscope** cmdlet for more information.
