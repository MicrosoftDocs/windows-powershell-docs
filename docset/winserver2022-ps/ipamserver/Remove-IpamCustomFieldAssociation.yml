- title: 'Example 1: Remove association between fields'
  code: |-
    The first command removes the association between the two custom fields, VmmLogicalNetwork and NetworkSite. The cmdlet prompts you before it removes associations. 
    PS C:\> Remove-IpamCustomFieldAssociation -CustomFieldOne "VmmLogicalNetwork" -CustomFieldTwo "NetworkSite" 
    Confirm

    This will permanently delete the Custom Field Association between Custom Field VmmLogicalNetwork and

    NetworkSite.Do you want to continue?

    [Y] Yes  [N] No  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "Y"): Y


    The second command uses the Get-IpamCustomFieldAssociation to get all associations. The associations that the first command removed do not appear.
    PS C:\> Get-IpamCustomFieldAssociation
    CustomFieldOne   : Region

    CustomFieldTwo   : Site

    AssociationValue : {Region01:Site09, Region01:Site10, Region01:Site11}
    CustomFieldOne   : ManagedByService

    CustomFieldTwo   : ServiceInstance

    AssociationValue : {IPAM:Localhost, MS DHCP:dhcp1.contoso.com}

  code: |-
    The first command uses the **Get-IpamCustomFieldAssociation** cmdlet to get all the associations specified by the ManagedByService custom field, and then passes them to the current cmdlet by using the pipeline operator. The cmdlet prompts you for confirmation, and then removes all the associations. 
    PS C:\> Get-IpamCustomFieldAssociation -CustomFieldOne "ManagedByService" | Remove-IpamCustomFieldAssociation
    Confirm

    This will permanently delete the Custom Field Association between Custom Field ManagedByService and

    ServiceInstance.Do you want to continue?

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 

    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt. 
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes. 
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets. 
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

  The **Remove-IpamCustomFieldAssociation** cmdlet removes an association between two custom fields that are defined in IP Address Management (IPAM).
  Specify the custom fields by using the *CustomFieldOne* and *CustomFieldTwo* parameters.
  The cmdlet does not find an association that contains both specified fields, it informs you of the error.
  The cmdlet does not delete the custom fields themselves.

  Use the **Get-IpamCustomFieldAssociation** cmdlet to see existing associations.
  Use the **Add-IpamCustomFieldAssociation** cmdlet to create associations.
  Use the **Set-IpamCustomFieldAssociation** cmdlet to modify associations.
