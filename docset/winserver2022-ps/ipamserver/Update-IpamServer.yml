parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 

    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt. 
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes. 
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets. 
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

name: Update-IpamServer
description: |-
  The **Update-IpamServer** cmdlet updates an IP Address Management (IPAM) server following an operating system upgrade.
  IPAM binaries and schema files are made available as a part of an upgrade.
  An error occurs if there is no update available.

  As part of an IPAM server update, this cmdlet performs the following steps:

  - Applies IPAM schema updates.
    The cmdlet performs data and schema validation of the existing IPAM database, and returns an error if the validation fails.
    A log is generated on the server in the %SystemDrive%\Windows\System32\IPAM\logs folder.
    If you specify the *DeleteSystemCheckFailureRows* parameter, the cmdlet proceeds to automatically delete the error rows.

  - Completes any required data format transformation.
    This will not result in any loss of existing data.

  - Applies changes in security groups and roles.

  No changes are made to any existing user configuration, such as adding users to a security group.
  Any customizations to IPAM task schedules are retained.
  In case of an error, any changes will be reverted.
