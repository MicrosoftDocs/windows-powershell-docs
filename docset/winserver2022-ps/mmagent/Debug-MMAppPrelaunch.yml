parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete. 

    The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt. 
    You can continue to work in the session while the job completes. 
    To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets. 
    To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet. 

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DisableDebugMode
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet turns off debug mode for the selected application.

  defaultValue: None

  aliases: ddm
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PackageFullName
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the full name of the AppX package that contains the application to be prelaunched in debug mode.

  defaultValue: None

  aliases: pfn
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PackageRelativeAppId
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the application ID of the application within the AppX package that is prelaunched.
    The application ID is found in the package manifest file.

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

description: |-
  The **Debug-MMAppPrelaunch** cmdlet debugs the application prelaunch of a specific application by triggering the prelaunch to occur and to exit debug mode for the application.

  Prelaunching is a new feature added in Windows® 8.1 that improves the launch performance of apps from the Windows Store by proactively launching frequently used apps in the background if they are not already running or suspended.
  This makes starting an app as fast as switching to a suspended app from the user's perspective.
  This command enables you to prelaunch an app into debug mode.

  You identify the application to prelaunch by including the *PackageFullName* and *PackageRelativeAppId* parameters.

  To turn off debugging, specify the application and also include the *DisableDebugMode* parameter.
