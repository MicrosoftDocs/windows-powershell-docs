    This example gets a virtual network adapter from the Remote Packet Capture provider for a network session.
    After you complete these commands to configure the network session, you can start and stop the event and packet capture for the network session by using the Start-NetEventSession and Stop-NetEventSession cmdlets.

    The first command uses the New-NetEventSession cmdlet to create a network session named NESession01.

    The second command uses the Add-NetEventPacketCaptureProvider cmdlet to add a Remote Packet Capture provider for the session named NESession01.

    The third command uses the Add-NetEventVmNetworkAdapter cmdlet to add the virtual network adapter named LargeGuid as a filter on the Remote Packet Capture provider.

    The fourth command uses the Add-NetEventVmNetworkAdapter cmdlet to add the virtual network adapter named LargeGuid02 as a filter on the Remote Packet Capture provider.

    The fifth command gets the virtual network adapters from the Remote Packet Capture provider.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimInstance" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssociatedPacketCaptureProvider
  description: |+
    Specifies the associated packet capture provider as a CIM object.
    To obtain the packet capture provider, use the Get-NetEventPacketCaptureProvider cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true

  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Name
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of names of virtual network adapters.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ShowInstalled
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet displays all network adapters that are installed on the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

description: |-
  The **Get-NetEventVmNetworkAdapter** cmdlet gets network adapters of a virtual machine from a Remote Packet Capture provider.
  Specify the names of the virtual network adapters.

  The protocol stack uses multiple layers to transmit, receive, and process network traffic as packets.
  The provider logs network traffic as Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) events.
