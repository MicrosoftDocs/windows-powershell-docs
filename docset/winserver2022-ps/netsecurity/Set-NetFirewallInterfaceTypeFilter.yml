parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimSession" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: GPOSession
  description: |+
    Targets the network GPO from which to retrieve the rules to be modified. 
    This parameter is used in the same way as the *PolicyStore* parameter.
    When modifying GPOs in Windows PowerShell®, each change to a GPO requires the entire GPO to be loaded, modified, and saved back.
    On a busy Domain Controller (DC), this can be a slow and resource-heavy operation.
    A GPO Session loads a domain GPO onto the local computer and makes all changes in a batch, before saving it back.
    This reduces the load on the DC and speeds up the Windows PowerShell cmdlets.
    To load a GPO Session, use the Open-NetGPO cmdlet.
    To save a GPO Session, use the Save-NetGPO cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimInstance" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: InputObject
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the input object that is used in a pipeline command.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="InterfaceType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: InterfaceType
  description: |+
    Specifies that only network connections made through the indicated interface types are subject to the requirements of this rule.
    This parameter specifies different authentication requirements for each of the three main network types. 
    The acceptable values for this parameter are: Any, Wired, Wireless, or RemoteAccess.
    The default value is Any.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Any, Wired, Wireless, RemoteAccess
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PassThru
  description: |+
    Returns an object representing the item with which you are working.
    By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PolicyStore
  description: |+
    Targets the policy store from which to retrieve the rules to be modified. 
    A policy store is a container for firewall and IPsec policy. 
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - PersistentStore: Sometimes called static rules, this store contains the persistent policy for the local computer.
    This policy is not from GPOs, and has been created manually or programmatically (during application installation) on the computer.
    Rules created in this store are attached to the ActiveStore and activated on the computer immediately. 
    - ActiveStore: This store contains the currently active policy, which is the sum of all policy stores that apply to the computer.
    This is the resultant set of policy (RSOP) for the local computer (the sum of all GPOs that apply to the computer), and the local stores (the PersistentStore, the static Windows service hardening (WSH), and the configurable WSH). 
    ---- GPOs are also policy stores.
    Computer GPOs can be specified as follows. 
    ------ `-PolicyStore hostname`. 
    ---- Active Directory GPOs can be specified as follows. 
    ------ `-PolicyStore domain.fqdn.com\GPO_Friendly_Namedomain.fqdn.comGPO_Friendly_Name`. 
    ------ Such as the following. 
    -------- `-PolicyStore localhost`
    -------- `-PolicyStore corp.contoso.com\FirewallPolicy`
    ---- Active Directory GPOs can be created using the **New-GPO** cmdlet or the Group Policy Management Console. 
    - RSOP: This read-only store contains the sum of all GPOs applied to the local computer. 
    - SystemDefaults: This read-only store contains the default state of firewall rules that ship with Windows Server® 2012. 
    - StaticServiceStore: This read-only store contains all the service restrictions that ship with Windows Server 2012.
    Optional and product-dependent features are considered part of Windows Server 2012 for the purposes of WFAS. 
    - ConfigurableServiceStore: This read-write store contains all the service restrictions that are added for third-party services.
    In addition, network isolation rules that are created for Windows Store application containers will appear in this policy store. 

    The default value is PersistentStore. 
    The Set-NetIPsecRule cmdlet cannot be used to add an object to a policy store.
    An object can only be added to a policy store at creation time with the Copy-NetIPsecRule cmdlet or with the New-NetIPsecRule cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: wi
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: NetSecurity.Set-NetFirewallInterfaceTypeFilter
name: Set-NetFirewallInterfaceTypeFilter
description: |-
  The **Set-NetFirewallInterfaceTypeFilter** cmdlet modifies the interface types associated with the input firewall or IPsec rules.

  See theGet-NetFirewallInterfaceTypeFilter cmdlet for more information about the interface type filters.

  To modify the interface type conditions, two methods can be used starting with the interface type filters returned by the Get-NetFirewallInterfaceTypeFilter cmdlet and optional additional querying. 

  - The network firewall interface type filter objects are piped into the Get-NetFirewallRule or Get-NetIPsecRule cmdlet.
  The Get-NetFirewallRule or Get-NetIPsecRule cmdlet returns the rules associated with the filters and pipes the rules into the Set-NetFirewallRule or Set-NetIPsecRule cmdlet, which configures the interface properties. 
  - Alternatively, the network firewall interface type filter objects are piped directly to this cmdlet, which modifies the *InterfaceType* parameter value of the rules.
