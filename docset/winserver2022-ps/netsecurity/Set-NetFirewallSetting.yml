- type: <xref href="PacketQueuing" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: EnablePacketQueuing
  description: |+
    Specifies how the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security handles packet queuing. 
    This parameter enables inbound or forward packet queuing independently, allowing the computer is able to evenly distribute CPU load to multiple CPUs for site-to-site IPsec tunnel scenarios.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are: None, Inbound, Forward, or NotConfigured. 

    - None: The firewall tracks the port numbers specified in PORT command requests and in the responses to PASV requests, and then allows the incoming FTP data traffic entering on the requested port number. 
    - Inbound: Inbound packet queuing is enabled. 
    - Forward: Forward packet queuing is enabled. 
    - NotConfigured: Valid only when configuring a GPO.
    Removes the setting from the GPO, which results in the policy not changing the value on the computer when the policy is applied. 

    The default value when managing a computer running Windows Server® 2012 is None. 
    When managing a Group Policy Object (GPO), the default setting is NotConfigured.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: None, Inbound, Forward, NotConfigured
- type: <xref href="GpoBoolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: EnableStatefulFtp
  description: |+
    Configures how Windows Firewall with Advanced Security handles FTP traffic that uses an initial connection on one port to request a data connection on a different port.
    This affects both active and passive FTP. 
    If active FTP is used, then the client initiates a connection to the server on TCP port 21 and includes a PORT command that indicates to the FTP server the port number on which it should respond.
    A typical firewall on the client would block this new connection as unsolicited inbound traffic since the packets to the new port are not in response to a request from that port. 
    If passive FTP is used, then the client initiates a connection to the server on TCP port 21 and includes the PASV command.
    The server responds on TCP port 21 with a port number that the client must use for subsequent data transfer.
    The client then initiates a connection to the server on the specified port.
    A typical firewall on the FTP server would block this new incoming data connection as unsolicited inbound traffic since the packets received at the new port are not in response to a request from that port. 
    When this parameter is True, the firewall examines the PORT and PASV requests for these other port numbers and then allows the corresponding data connection to the port number that was requested. 
    - True: The firewall tracks the port numbers specified in PORT command requests and in the responses to PASV requests, and then allows the incoming FTP data traffic entering on the requested port number. 
    - False: The firewall does not track outgoing PORT commands or PASV responses, and so incoming data connections on the PORT or PASV requested port is blocked as an unsolicited incoming connection. 
    - NotConfigured: Valid only when configuring a GPO.
    Removes the setting from the GPO, which results in the policy not changing the value on the computer when the policy is applied. 
    The default value is False. 
    The default value when managing a computer running firstref_vista or firstref_client_7 is True. 
    The default value when managing a computer running firstref_longhorn or firstref_server_7 is False. 
    When managing a Group Policy Object (GPO), the default value is NotConfigured.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: False, True, NotConfigured
- type: <xref href="GpoBoolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: EnableStatefulPptp
  description: |+
    Configures how Windows Firewall with Advanced Security handles PPTP traffic. 
    If a connection is made through TCP port 1723 in nextref_vista, then Windows Firewall recognizes the connection as being established through PPTP.
    By default, Windows Firewall uses a stateful PPTP protocol analyzer to determine whether it can receive packets through the TCP port 1723 connection.
    Therefore, the stateful PPTP protocol analyzer may reject as not valid any traffic that uses a protocol other than PPTP. 
    - True: The firewall examines the packets from port 1723 and determines whether the traffic is valid PPTP traffic. 
    - False: The firewall does not examine the packets from port 1723 to determine whether the traffic is valid PPTP traffic. 
    - NotConfigured: Valid only when configuring a GPO.
    Removes the setting from the GPO, which results in the policy not changing the value on the computer when the policy is applied. 
    The default value is False. 
    When managing a GPO, the default value is NotConfigured.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: False, True, NotConfigured
- type: <xref href="TrafficExemption" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Exemptions
  description: |+
    Specifies the protocols to be exempted from IPsec requirements. 
    The acceptable values for this parameter are: None, NeighborDiscovery, Icmp, RouterDiscovery, Dhcp, or NotConfigured. 

    - None: No protocols are exempted. 
    - NeighborDiscovery: Exempt IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol traffic. 
    - Icmp: Exempt ICMP, for both IPv4 and IPv6, protocol traffic.
    This option is available on computers that are running Windows® 7 or nextref_server_7. 
    - RouterDiscovery: Exempt router discovery traffic. 
    - Dhcp: Exempt DHCP, for both IPv4 and IPv6, protocol traffic.
    This option is available on computers that are running Windows® 7 or nextref_server_7. 
    The default value when managing a local computer that is running Windows® 7 or nextref_server_7 is NeighborDiscovery,Dhcp. 
    The default value when managing a local computer that is running nextref_vista, nextref_longhorn, Windows XP®, or Windows Server® 2003 is NeighborDiscovery. 

    The default value when managing a GPO is NotConfigured.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: None, NeighborDiscovery, Icmp, RouterDiscovery, Dhcp, NotConfigured
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: GPOSession
  description: |+
    Specifies the network GPO from which to retrieve the rules to be modified. 
    This parameter is used in the same way as the *PolicyStore* parameter.
    When modifying GPOs in Windows PowerShell®, each change to a GPO requires the entire GPO to be loaded, modified, and saved back.
    On a busy Domain Controller (DC), this can be a slow and resource-heavy operation.
    A GPO Session loads a domain GPO onto the local computer and makes all changes in a batch, before saving it back.
    This reduces the load on the DC and speeds up the Windows PowerShell cmdlets.
    To load a GPO Session, use the Open-NetGPO cmdlet.
    To save a GPO Session, use the Save-NetGPO cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimInstance" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: InputObject
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the input object that is used in a pipeline command.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="KeyEncoding" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: KeyEncoding
  description: |+
    Specifies the type of key encoding to be used. 
    The acceptable values for this parameter are: UTF16 or UTF8.
    The default value is UTF8.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: UTF16, UTF8, NotConfigured
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MaxSAIdleTimeSeconds
  description: |+
    Specifies the number of minutes that a security association (SA) can stay idle before being deleted. 
    Once deleted, a new SA must be established before computers under the scope of the original SA can communicate again. 
    The acceptable values for this parameter are: 300 through 3600 seconds, or NotConfigured. 

    - A non-zero value, including 300 through 3600, specifies the desired lifetime. 
    - NotConfigured: Valid only when configuring a GPO.
    Removes the setting from the GPO, which results in the policy not changing the value on the computer when the policy is applied.
    This parameter value is case-sensitive and NotConfigured can only be specified using dot-notation. 

    The default value when managing a local computer is 300 seconds (5 minutes). 
    When managing a GPO, the default value is NotConfigured.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PassThru
  description: |+
    Returns an object representing the item with which you are working.
    By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PolicyStore
  description: |+
    Specifies the policy store from which to retrieve the rules to be modified. 
    A policy store is a container for firewall and IPsec policy. 
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - PersistentStore: Sometimes called static rules, this store contains the persistent policy for the local computer.
    This policy is not from GPOs, and has been created manually or programmatically (during application installation) on the computer.
    Rules created in this store are attached to the ActiveStore and activated on the computer immediately. 
    - ActiveStore: This store contains the currently active policy, which is the sum of all policy stores that apply to the computer.
    This is the resultant set of policy (RSOP) for the local computer (the sum of all GPOs that apply to the computer), and the local stores (the PersistentStore, the static Windows service hardening (WSH), and the configurable WSH). 
    ---- GPOs are also policy stores.
    Computer GPOs can be specified as follows. 
    ------ `-PolicyStore hostname`. 
    ---- Active Directory GPOs can be specified as follows. 
    ------ `-PolicyStore domain.fqdn.com\GPO_Friendly_Namedomain.fqdn.comGPO_Friendly_Name`. 
    ------ Such as the following. 
    -------- `-PolicyStore localhost`
    -------- `-PolicyStore corp.contoso.com\FirewallPolicy`
    ---- Active Directory GPOs can be created using the **New-GPO** cmdlet or the Group Policy Management Console. 
    - RSOP: This read-only store contains the sum of all GPOs applied to the local computer. 
    - SystemDefaults: This read-only store contains the default state of firewall rules that ship with Windows Server 2012. 
    - StaticServiceStore: This read-only store contains all the service restrictions that ship with Windows Server 2012.
    Optional and product-dependent features are considered part of Windows Server 2012 for the purposes of WFAS. 
    - ConfigurableServiceStore: This read-write store contains all the service restrictions that are added for third-party services.
    In addition, network isolation rules that are created for Windows Store application containers will appear in this policy store. 
    The default value is PersistentStore. 
    The Set-NetFirewallRule cmdlet cannot be used to add an object to a policy store.
    An object can only be added to a policy store at creation time with the Copy-NetFirewallRule cmdlet or with the New-NetFirewallRule cmdlet.
