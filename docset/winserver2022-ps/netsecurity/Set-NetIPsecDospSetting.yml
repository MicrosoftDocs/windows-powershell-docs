  name: DefBlockExemptDscp
  description: |+
    Specifies the 6-bit value, specified as an integer from 1 to 63, that is placed in the differentiated services code point (DSCP) field of the IPv6 header when the traffic type matches traffic that is by default exempted from the default block behavior such as IPsec authenticated, IPsec unauthenticated, and ICMPv6 traffic.
    The DSCP value can be used in Quality of Service (QoS) implementations to prioritize network traffic and help ensure that less important network packets do not consume so much bandwidth that they interfere with the successful delivery of more important network packets. 
    The acceptable values for this parameter are: 1 through 63, and Disabled. 

    - Disabled: This turns off DSCP marking for traffic that is by default exempted from the default block behavior.
    This includes IPsec authenticated, IPsec unauthenticated, and ICMPv6 traffic.
    This parameter is case sensitive and requires Disabled to be specified using dot-notation. 

    The default value is Disabled.

  name: DefBlockExemptRateLimitBytesPerSec
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum rate at which IPsec authenticated, IPsec unauthenticated, and ICMPv6 inbound network traffic such as traffic that is by default exempted from the default block behavior is forwarded from the public interface to the internal interface. 
    The acceptable values for this parameter are: 1 through 4,294,967,295 bytes per second.
    The default value is 102400.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="DospKeyModules" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: EnabledKeyingModules
  description: |+
    Specifies the IPsec negotiation protocol, or keying module, to allow.
    The IPv6 address or subnet to which the specified IPsec negotiation protocol is allowed to be sent with the *PrivateV6Address* parameter can be optionally specified.
    By default, only IPsec negotiation traffic that uses AuthIP is allowed to all addresses. 
    ICMPv6 network traffic is always allowed to enable Teredo and other advanced network scenarios to work.
    The IPsec-protected traffic that is part of an established connection that uses ESP is always allowed, as long as the connection has not been idle for more than the number of seconds specified with the *StateIdleTimeoutSeconds* parameter. 
    The acceptable values for this parameter are: None, IkeV1, IkeV2, or AuthIP.
    The default value is AuthIP.

  defaultValue: None

  name: FilteringFlags
  description: |+
    Specifies the action to take on network traffic that matches the Dosp setting address filters the public V6 address and the privateV6 address. 
    Only one filter can be applied to a specific address or subnet.
    If a second Dosp setting with the exact same address or subnet parameter is created, then an error is displayed.
    If an address matches more than one filter, then the most specific match is selected and the corresponding filter is applied.
    For example, 2006:2006::2 matches a filter with the prefix 2006:2006::2/128 more closely than a filter with the prefix 2006:2006::2/64. 
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - None: IPsec DoS protection feature drops all IPv4 traffic, and all non-IPsec IPv6 traffic (except ICMPv6) that is forwarded between a public interface and an internal interface. 
    - DisableDefaultBlock: IPsec DoS protection feature blocks no traffic. 
    - FilterBlock: Specifies that network traffic that matches the Dosp setting address filters using the *PublicV6Address* and *PrivateV6Address* parameters is blocked even if it is IPsec-protected. 
    - FilterExempt: Specifies that IPv6 network traffic that matches the Dosp setting address filters using the *PublicV6Address* and *PrivateV6Address* parameters does not have to be IPsec-protected to be allowed through. 

    The default value is None.

    This parameter specifies the 6-bit value, specified as an integer from 1 to 63, that is placed in the DSCP field of the IPv6 header, when the traffic type matches ICMPv6 protocol traffic.
    The DSCP value can be used in Quality of Service (QoS) implementations to prioritize network traffic and help ensure that less important network packets do not consume so much bandwidth that the packets interfere with the successful delivery of more important network packets. 
    The acceptable values for this parameter are: 1 through 63, and Disabled.

    To specify that the IPv6 network traffic that matches the Dosp setting address filters using the *PublicV6Address* and *PrivateV6Address* parameters does not have to be IPsec-protected to be allowed through set the *FilteringFlags* parameter to the filter exempt value. 
    This parameter specifies the 6-bit value, specified as an integer from 1 to 63, that is placed in the DSCP field of the IPv6 header when the traffic type matches the exempted address filter traffic.
    The DSCP value can be used in Quality of Service (QoS) implementations to prioritize network traffic and help ensure that less important network packets do not consume so much bandwidth that they interfere with the successful delivery of more important network packets. 
    The acceptable values for this parameter are: 1 through 63, and Disabled.

  name: PrivateV6Address
  description: |+
    Specifies the internal IPsec address or subnet that matches the Dosp address filter. 
    This parameter adds a filter that either blocks or allows via exempting the network traffic that is not IPv6 and IPsec-protected from the specified public address or subnet using the *PublicV6Address* parameter to the specified internal address or subnet using this parameter.
    This behavior, referring to blocking or exempting, is specified with the *FilteringFlags* parameter. 
    Only one filter can be applied to a specific address or subnet.
    If a second rule with the exact same address or subnet parameter is created, then an error is displayed.
    If an address matches more than one filter, then the most specific match is selected and the corresponding filter is applied.
    For example, 2006:2006::2 matches a filter with the prefix 2006:2006::2/128 more closely than a filter with the prefix 2006:2006::2/64.
    If both the *PublicV6Address* parameter and this parameter are specified, then the Dosp rule treats the parameter values as a logical AND operator.
    Traffic matches the rule if it comes from an address with the specified public prefix and the traffic is destined for an address with the specified internal prefix. 
    Network traffic of the specified protocol as specified using the *EnabledKeyingModules* parameter that is sent from an address or subnet not on the list is dropped.

    This parameter adds a filter that either blocks or allows via exempting the network traffic that is not IPv6 and IPsec-protected from the specified public address or subnet using this parameter to the specified internal address or subnet using the *PrivateV6Address* parameter.
    This behavior, referring to blocking or exempting, is specified with the *FilteringFlags* parameter.
