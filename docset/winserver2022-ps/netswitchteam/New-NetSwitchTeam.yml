    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

description: |-
  The **New-NetSwitchTeam** cmdlet creates a switch team.
  A switch team must have a name for the team and must be created with one or more members, or network adapters.

  The network switch team is a team that is controlled by a Hyper-V extensible switch forwarding extension.
  No other cmdlets can be used to manage a switch team and the Network Switch Team Cmdlets in Windows PowerShell must not be used to manage standard, or non-switch, network adapter teams.
