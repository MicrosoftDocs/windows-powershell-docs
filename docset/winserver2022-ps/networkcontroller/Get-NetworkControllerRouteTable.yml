  This cmdlet retrieves the settings of a route table from the Network Controller. If you want to route traffic to virtual appliances in your environment, you can specify routes and associate them to a virtual subnet. Subnets rely on system routes until a route table is associated to the subnet. After an association exists, user defined routes are given higher priority.
