    The first command creates a network controller node object, and then stores it in the $NodeObject variable.

    The second command gets a certificate named NCEncryption, and then stores it in the $Certificate variable.
    The command uses standard Windows PowerShell® cmdlets.
    For more information, type `Get-Help Get-Item`, `Get-Help Get-ChildItem`, and `Get-Help Where`.

    The third command creates a network controller cluster by using the **Install-NetworkControllerCluster** cmdlet.
    The cluster contains the node object stored in $NodeObject.

    The final command deploys the network controller in a test environment.
    Since single node is used in the deployment, there is no high availability support.
    This network controller employs no authentication between the cluster nodes, or between the REST clients and network controller.
    The command specifies the $Certificate to encrypt the traffic between the REST clients and network controller.

    The first three commands create network controller node objects, and then stores them in the $Node01, $Node02, and $Node03 variables.

    The fourth command gets a certificate named NCEncryption, and then stores it in the $Certificate variable.
    The command uses standard cmdlets.

    The fifth command creates a network controller cluster by using the **Install-NetworkControllerCluster** cmdlet.
    The cluster contains the node objects stored in the variables.

    The final command deploys the network controller in a domain joined environment.
    Network controller uses Kerberos authentication between the cluster nodes, and between the REST clients and network controller.
    Only clients that are part of the RestClients security group can communicate with the network controller.
    The certificate in $Certificate is used to encrypt traffic between the REST clients and network controller.

  The **Install-NetworkController** cmdlet creates a network controller application on the network controller cluster.
  After you run this cmdlet, the network controller is running.

  The steps for configuring a network controller are as follows: 

  - Install the network controller role on all the computers that will be functioning as a network controller in your deployment.
  - From one of those computers (or any other remote computer), run the **New-NetworkControllerNodeObject** cmdlet to enter the details of the node to be part of the deployment.
  Repeat this step for all the computers that are part of the deployment.
  These node objects will be passed as a parameter to the next cmdlet. 
  - Run the **Install-NetworkControllerCluster** cmdlet to create a new network controller cluster.
  - Run the **Install-NetworkController** cmdlet to create the network controller application on top of the cluster.
