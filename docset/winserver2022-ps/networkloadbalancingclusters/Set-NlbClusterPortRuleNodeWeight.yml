    This command sets the weight for all port rules to equal the load weight on all nodes.
    This is applicable for port rules using the Multiple hosts.
    Note that this has to be set on all cluster nodes to achieve the desired effect.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Equal
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet sets the port rule weight to Equal on the cluster node.
    This specifies that all nodes distribute the network load equally.
    This parameter is only applicable when the port rule filtering mode is Multiple hosts.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: E
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: HostName
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the cluster host against which this cmdlet is run.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `.` is entered, then the local cluster is assumed.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Host, HN, H
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="PortRule" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: InputObject

  description: |+
    Specifies an array of cluster port rules on which this cmdlet sets the load weight.
    This is only applicable when the port rule filtering mode is Multiple hosts.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />

- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: LoadWeight
  description: |+
    Specifies the load weight for the given port rule to use for this node.
    This is only applicable when the port rule filtering mode is Multiple hosts.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are: 0 through 100.

  defaultValue: None

name: Set-NlbClusterPortRuleNodeWeight
description: |-
  The **Set-NlbClusterPortRuleNodeWeight** cmdlet sets the load weight of a port rule for a specific Network Load Balancing (NLB) node.
  The load weight applies only for the Multiple hosts filtering mode.
  When using the Multiple hosts filtering mode, the load weight specifies the relative amount of load-balanced network traffic that this node should handle for the associated port rule.
  Allowed integer values range from 0 (zero) to 100.
  To prevent a host from handling any network traffic, set the load weight to 0 (zero).
  The actual fraction of traffic handled by each node is computed as the local load weight divided by the sum of all load weights across the cluster.
  Different load weights can be specified for each node in the cluster using the *LoadWeight* parameter.
  Or, all nodes can be specified to distribute the network load equally by using the *Equal* parameter instead of the *LoadWeight* parameter.

  This operation changes the configuration on all cluster nodes.
  As a result, the NLB cluster restarts the convergence process on all nodes to guarantee that configuration changes have been applied on all nodes and that a consistent state is reached.
  Any additional operations on the NLB cluster is not initiated until all cluster nodes have completed the convergence process and are back to the converged state.
