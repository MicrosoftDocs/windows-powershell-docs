    The `Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure.CimInstance` object is a wrapper class that displays Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) objects.
    The path after the pound sign (`#`) provides the namespace and class name for the underlying WMI object.

    When the *Passthru* parameter is specified, this cmdlet outputs a modified 6to4 configuration object.

    If there is no global IPv6 address present and no global IPv4 address present, then the host does not have a 6to4 interface.
    If there is no global IPv6 address present but there is a global IPv4 address present, then the host has a 6to4 interface.

  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

name: Set-Net6to4Configuration
description: |-
  The **Set-Net6to4Configuration** cmdlet sets the 6to4 configuration of both client computers and servers.

  6to4 is an address assignment and router-to-router automatic tunneling technology that is described in [RFC 3056: Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=256388).
  6to4 provides a globally-routable IPv6 address to a host with a public IPv4 address.
  This IPv6 address can be used to connect to other 6to4 hosts or the IPv6 Internet.

  This cmdlet is similar in functionality to the `netsh interface 6to4 context` command.
