  description: |-
    This example connects with an IPMI device and returns hardware and firmware information for the device.

    The first command uses the **Get-Credential** cmdlet to create a credential, and then stores it in the **$Credential** variable.
    The cmdlet prompts you for a user name and password.
    For more information, type `Get-Help Get-Credential`.

    The second command returns the hardware and firmware information from the target computer.
    The command connects with the remote hardware device that has the management IP address 10.0.0.29 by using the IPMI management protocol and the default port (623).
    The command specifies the credential object stored in the **$Credential** variable.

    The EnabledState property indicates whether the computer is on or off or in an alternate state, such as quiesce.

- title: 'Example 2: Get information from a remote WSMAN device'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> $Credential = Get-Credential Admin
    PS C:\> Get-PcsvDevice -TargetAddress "10.0.0.30" -Credential $Credential -ManagementProtocol WSMan -Port 664 -UseSSL -SkipCACheck -SkipCNCheck -SkipRevocationCheck
  description: |-
    This example connects with a WS-Management device by using a custom port, and returns the hardware and firmware information for the device.
    The remote device uses a self-signed certificate for authentication, so the Get-PcsvDevice cmdlet specifies the **SkipCACheck** and **SkipCNCheck** parameters.
    Specify these parameters only for connecting to trusted remote hardware devices.

    The first command uses the **Get-Credential** cmdlet to create a credential, and then stores it in the **$Credential** variable.
    The cmdlet prompts you for a user name and password.
    For more information, type `Get-Help Get-Credential`.

    The second command returns the hardware and firmware information from the target computer.
    The command connects with the target computer that has the management IP address 10.0.0.30 by using the WS-Management protocol, SSL, and port 664.
    The command specifies the credential object stored in the **$Credential** variable.

    The command specifies that the client connects by using HTTPS without validating that a CA authority signed the server certificate.
    The command specifies that the certificate common name (CN) of the server does not need to match the host name of the server.
    The command specifies that the cmdlet skips the revocation check of server certificates.

- title: 'Example 3: Get information from a remote WSMAN device over HTTP'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Set-Item WSMan:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts "10.0.0.30"
    PS C:\> Set-Item WSMan:\localhost\Client\AllowUnencrypted true
    PS C:\> $Credential = Get-Credential Admin
    PS C:\> Get-PCSVDevice -TargetAddress 10.0.0.30 -ManagementProtocol WSMan -Port 16992 -Credential $Credential -Authentication Digest
  description: |-
    This example connects with a WS-Management using HTTP.
    Since the traffic is unencrypted, additional configuration on the management client is required.

    The first two commands create the configuration that the WS-Management client on Windows requires to enable unencrypted WSMAN traffic.
    This is a one-time only configuration.

    The third command uses the **Get-Credential** cmdlet to create a credential, and then stores it in the **$Credential** variable.
    The cmdlet prompts you for a user name and password.
    For more information, type `Get-Help Get-Credential`.

    The fourth command connects with the target computer that has the management IP address 10.0.0.30 by using the WS-Management protocol and port 16992.
    The command specifies the credential object stored in the **$Credential** variable.
    The command specifies the Digest authentication method for the device.

  description: |+
    Specifies a management protocol used to communicate with a device.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - WSMAN
    - IPMI

    Specify WSMAN for devices that represent information by using Systems Management Architecture for Server Hardware (SMASH), Desktop and mobile Architecture for System Hardware (DASH) or Physical Computer System View (PCSV) profiles.

    Specifies a port on the remote computer to use for the management connection.
    If you do not specify a port, the cmdlet uses the following default ports: 

    - IPMI and WSMAN over HTTP.
    Port 623.
    - WSMAN over HTTPS.

    Indicates that the client connects by using HTTPS without validating that a trusted CA signed the server certificate.
    Do not specify this parameter if you specify a value of IPMI for the **ManagementProtocol** parameter.

    Do not specify this parameter unless you can establish trust in another way, such as if the remote computer is part of a network that is physically secure and isolated, or if the remote computer is a trusted host in a Windows Remote Management (WinRM) configuration.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SkipCNCheck
  description: |+
    Indicates that the certificate common name of the server does not need to match the host name of the server.
    Do not specify this parameter if you specify a value of IPMI for the **ManagementProtocol** parameter.

    Specify this parameter only for managing devices by using WSMAN over HTTPS.
    Be sure to specify this parameter only for trusted computers.

  name: TargetAddress
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the name or IP address of the management port on the remote hardware device.
    For server hardware, this is typically a dedicated BMC IP address.
    For other devices, like network switches, this is the IP address of their management port.
    For desktop and mobile devices, the BMC sometimes shares the same IP address as the computer.

  aliases: CN, ComputerName, IpAddress
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: TimeoutSec

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: UseSSL
  description: |+
    Indicates that the server connects to the target computer by using SSL.
    WSMAN encrypts all content transmitted over the network.
    Specify this parameter to use the additional protection of HTTPS instead of HTTP.
    If you specify this parameter and SSL is not available on the connection port, the command fails.

uid: PCSVDevice.Get-PcsvDevice
name: Get-PcsvDevice
description: |-
  The **Get-PcsvDevice** cmdlet gets information about a remote device.
  The cmdlet connects to a remote device, for example, a baseboard management controller, and collects hardware inventory information and information about the firmware installed on the device.
  The cmdlet communicates with the remote device by using the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) or WS-Management (WSMAN) protocols.
