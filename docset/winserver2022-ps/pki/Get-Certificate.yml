  code: |-
    PS C:\>$up = Get-Credential

    PS C:\>Get-Certificate -Template SslWebServer -DnsName www.contoso.com,www.fabrikam.com -Url https://www.contoso.com/Policy/service.svc -Credential $up -CertStoreLocation cert:\LocalMachine\My
  description: |-
    This example submits a certificate request for the SslWebServer template to the specific URL using the user name and password credentials.
    The request will have two DNS names in it.
    This is for a certificate in the machine store.
    If the request is issued, then the returned certificate is installed in the machine MY store and the certificate in the EnrollmentResult structure is returned with the status Issued.
    If the request is made pending, then the request is installed in the machine REQUEST store and the request in the EnrollmentResult structure is returned with the status Pending.

    PS C:\>$request = Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\LocalMachine\Request\EEDEF61D4FF6EDBAAD538BB08CCAADDC3EE28FF

    PS C:\>Get-Certificate -Request $request
  description: |-
    This example retrieves the certificate identified by $request.
    If the authentication type for $request.EnrollmentServer.AuthType is not Kerberos, then look in the credential store to see if there is a credential for $request.EnrollmentServer.Url.
    If there is a credential, then use it.
    If there is no credential, then Windows PowerShell® will request it (if Windows PowerShell is in Interactive mode).

uid: pki.Get-Certificate
name: Get-Certificate
description: |-
  The **Get-Certificate** cmdlet can be used to submit a certificate request and install the resulting certificate, install a certificate from a pending certificate request, and enroll for ldap.
  If the request is issued, then the returned certificate is installed in the store determined by the **CertStoreLocation** parameter and return the certificate in the EnrollmentResult structure with status Issued.
  If the request is made pending, then the request is installed in the machine REQUEST store and a request is returned in the EnrollmentResult structure with status Pending.

  This cmdlet can be used in a Stateless mode where this cmdlet does not look up anything in the vault or in a Stateful mode where it looks at registered certificate enrollment policy servers by identifier (ID) and credential.
  When used with a request object and no credential, this cmdlet will look up credentials in the vault based on the URL for the enrollment policy server.

  This cmdlet will not accept a policy server identifier (ID).
  If a URL is not specified, then only the default certificate enrollment policy ID is used and the cmdlet will attempt to obtain policy information from any of its URLs.

  Delegation may be required when using this cmdlet with Windows PowerShell® remoting and changing user configuration.
