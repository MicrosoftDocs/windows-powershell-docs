  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.

  name: ComputerName
  description: |+
    Specifies the IPv4 or IPv6 address, or host name, of the computer on which the Remote Access server computer specific tasks should be run.
    When this parameter is specified the cmdlet looks for the specified user or host IP on that Remote Access server.

  defaultValue: None

    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

description: "The **Disconnect-VpnUser** cmdlet disconnects a VPN connection originated by a specific user or originating from a specific client computer.\r\n\r\nThe list of active VPN connections originating or ending on a VPN server is stored in the inbox accounting store on the server.\r\nTherefore, this cmdlet would have to be run on the server where the connection starts or ends to disconnect a user.\r\n\r\nA VPN connection can be disconnected in one of the following two ways.\r\nNote: Only one of these methods can be used at a time. \r\n                       \r\n -- By user name of the user who originated the connection. \r\n                       \r\n -- By tunnel IP address assigned by the VPN server."
