    The `Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure.CimInstance` object is a wrapper class that displays Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) objects.
    The path after the pound sign (`#`) provides the namespace and class name for the underlying WMI object.

    The RemoteAccessAccounting object consists of the following properties: 

     -- The status of RADIUS accounting (Disabled, Windows, ExternalRadius) and the list of RADIUS servers in the case of ExternalRadius accounting.
    If there is no external radius accounting enabled, then the list of Radius servers is empty. 

     -- The status of inbox accounting (Enabled, Disabled) and its properties. 

     -- Time span of the store. 

     -- Number of used bytes. 

     -- Percentage of used bytes. 

     -- Number of free bytes. 

     -- Percentage of free bytes. 

     -- Time stamp of the first record in the database. 

     -- Time stamp of the last record in the database.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimSession" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ComputerName
  description: |+
    Specifies the IPv4 or IPv6 address, or host name, of the computer on which the Remote Access server computer specific tasks should be run.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Cn
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: RemoteAccess.Get-RemoteAccessAccounting
name: Get-RemoteAccessAccounting
description: |-
  The **Get-RemoteAccessAccounting** cmdlet displays the accounting configuration for Remote Access, such as the different types of accounting that are enabled and the respective configuration.

  The accounting configuration is applicable globally, such as the enabled state of a particular kind of accounting and the resulting enabled state on all DA servers in the corporate network.
  The associated configuration is also applicable for all computers in the corporate network. 

   -- All Remote Access servers have the same configured Accounting RADIUS servers. 

   -- The default limit set for the inbox accounting store size is the same on all Remote Access servers.

  Therefore, this cmdlet is not impacted by a multi-site deployment.
