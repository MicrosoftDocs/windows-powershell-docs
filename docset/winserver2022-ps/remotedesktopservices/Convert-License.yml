    This example converts all the unissued licenses in a key pack to per-device or per-user licenses.

    The first command gets all the license key packs on the current computer by using the Get-WmiObject cmdlet, and then stores them as an array in the $KeyPack variable.
    For more information, type `Get-Help Get-WmiObject`.

    The second command uses standard array notation to specify the third member of the $KeyPack array.
    The command specifies the **KeyPackId** property of that key pack as the value for the *KeyPackId* parameter.
    The command converts the licenses in that key pack.
    To see all the properties of a key pack, use the Get-Member cmdlet.
    For more information, type `Get-Help Get-Member`.

  The **Convert-License** cmdlet converts licenses in a specified key pack.
  A key pack contains a number of licenses that enable clients to connect to a Remote Desktop Session Host (RD Session Host) server.
  Remote Desktop Licensing (RD Licensing) supports the following kinds of licenses:

  - Per-device.
  RD Licensing requires a license for each device that connects to an RD Session Host server.
  - Per-user.
  RD Licensing requires a license for each user that connects to an RD Session Host server.

  If a key pack contains per-device licenses, this cmdlet converts them to per-user licenses.
  If a key pack contains per-user licenses, this cmdlet converts them to per-device licenses.
  This cmdlet returns an object corresponding to the new key pack.

  You can specify how many licenses in the key pack to convert by using the *Count* parameter.
  If the number that you specify is greater than the number of available unissued keys, the cmdlet raises an error.
  If you do not specify a value for this parameter, this cmdlet converts all the licenses in the key pack.
