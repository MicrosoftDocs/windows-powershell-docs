### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Deletes a storage pool and associated VirtualDisk objects.
module: Storage
notes: |-
  * When used in Failover Cluster, cmdlets from the Storage module operate on cluster level (all servers in the cluster).
inputs:
- name: <xref href="Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure.CimInstance#ROOT/Microsoft/Windows/Storage/MSFT_StoragePool" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    The `Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure.CimInstance` object is a wrapper class that displays Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) objects.
    The path after the pound sign (`#`) provides the namespace and class name for the underlying WMI object.
outputs:
- name: <xref href="Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure.CimInstance#ROOT/Microsoft/Windows/Storage/MSFT_StoragePool" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />

examples:
- title: EXAMPLE 1
  code: |-
    PS C:\>Remove-StoragePool -FriendlyName "DemoPool"
  description: |-
    This example removes the storage pool with the friendly name DemoPool.
    When a storage pool is created, it consumes one or more physical disks to create the pool, from which virtual disks are subsequently created.
    The removal of a storage pool, which can only be performed after all virtual disks have first been removed, destroys the storage pool, and returns the physical disks back to a non-pooled state, where they may be re-consumed.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete.

  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session

  description: |+
    Sends items from the interactive window down the pipeline as input to other cmdlets.
    By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

    To send items from the interactive window down the pipeline, click to select the items and then click OK.
    Shift-click and Ctrl-click are supported.

  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
