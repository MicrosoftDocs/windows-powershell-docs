### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Resets storage reliability counters for a disk.
module: Storage
notes: |-
  * When used in Failover Cluster, cmdlets from the Storage module operate on cluster level (all servers in the cluster).
inputs:
- name: <xref href="Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure.CimInstance#ROOT/Microsoft/Windows/Storage/MSFT_StorageReliabilityCounter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    You can use the pipeline operator to pass an arrary of MSFT_StorageReliabilityCounter objects to the *InputObject* parameter.
outputs:
- name: <xref href="Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure.CimInstance#ROOT/Microsoft/Windows/Storage/MSFT_StorageReliabilityCounter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    This cmdlet outputs an array of objects that represent storage reliability counter data.

examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Reset the reliability counters for two physical disks'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> $Counter1 = Get-StorageReliabilityCounter -PhysicalDisk (Get-PhysicalDisk "PhysicalDisk01")
    PS C:\> $Counter2 = Get-StorageReliabilityCounter -PhysicalDisk (Get-PhysicalDisk "PhysicalDisk02")
    PS C:\> Reset-StorageReliabilityCounter -InputObject $Counter1, $Counter2
  description: |-
    The first command gets the storage reliability counters for the physical disk named PhysicalDisk01, and stores the counters in the **$Counter1** variable.

    The second command gets the storage reliability counters for the physical disk named PhysicalDisk02, and stores the counters in the **$Counter2** variable.

    The last command resets the storage reliability counters for the physical disks stored in **$Counter1** and **$Counter2**.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimSession" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimInstance" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Disk
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the **Disk** for which to reset reliability counters.
    To obtain a **Disk** object, use the Get-Disk cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimInstance" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: InputObject
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the input object that is used in a pipeline command.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PassThru
  description: |+
    Returns an object representing the item with which you are working.
    By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="CimInstance" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PhysicalDisk
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the physical disk for which to reset reliability counters.
    To obtain a **PhysicalDisk** object, use the Get-PhysicalDisk cmdlet

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: Storage.Reset-StorageReliabilityCounter
name: Reset-StorageReliabilityCounter
description: |-
  The **Reset-StorageReliabilityCounter** cmdlet resets the storage reliability counters to zero for a virtual disk or physical disk.
  The cmdlet resets the following storage reliability counters for I/O operations: read latency, write latency, and flush latency.
  If an unexpected issue with a disk or driver causes high latency, use this cmdlet to discount the sharp rise in latencies when you monitor I/O performance.
