    Are you sure you want to perform this action? 
    Suspending replication on the source replication group ReplicationGroup01 will dismount the file
    system, preventing all application access to the replicated volume(s) in this replication
    group. Use Sync-SRGroup to remount the file system and resume replication. To remove a
    replication partnership, please use Remove-SRPartnership. Are you sure you want to
    continue?[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "Y"):

    This command suspends the replication group named ReplicationGroup01 from replication.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete.

  name: CimSession
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ComputerName
  description: |+
    Specifies a single replica host computer NetBIOS name or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of a computer for which this cmdlet pauses replication.
    The default value is the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: CN
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />

  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of the replication group for which this cmdlet pauses replication.

    If you pause replication, Storage Replica dismounts the volume.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: N
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
