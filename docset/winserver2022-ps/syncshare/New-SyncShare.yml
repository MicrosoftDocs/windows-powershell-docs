parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete.

    Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
    Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
    The default is the current session on the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: Session
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Description
  description: |+
    Specifies the description for a sync share configuration.
    The description is visible in Server Manager and in Windows PowerShell, but does not appear to end users.
    The description can have a maximum of a 150 characters.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: FallbackEnterpriseID
  description: |+
    Specifies the fallback Enterprise ID that the Sync Share uses if it cannot successfully query Active Directory® Domain Services (nextref_adds).
    If the server cannot successfully query nextref_adds, the server uses the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the sync server as the fallback Enterprise ID unless you specify a different Enterprise ID by using this parameter.
    The Enterprise ID is issued by the work folders client to encrypt data on the PC or device.

    The Enterprise ID is typically constructed by querying nextref_adds for the primary SMTP address of the user, removing the username and ampersand (user@), and sending the remainder to the client as the Enterprise ID.
    For instance, EvanNarvaez@Contoso.com yields the contoso.com Enterprise ID.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: InheritParentFolderPermission
  description: |+
    Indicates that the Sync Share inherits the permissions of the parent folder.
    If you specify this parameter, user folders inherit permissions from the parent folder of the sync share, and administrators can access the data.
    If you do not specify this parameter, each user is granted exclusive access to their user folder, and administrators have no access rights.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="UInt64" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MaxUploadFile
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum file size, in bytes, that users can upload to the server.
    The minimum value that you can specify is 1 MB.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies a name for the Sync Share.
    The name that you specify has the following requirements: 

    - The name must be unique on the Sync server
    - The name can have a maximum of 75 characters
    - You cannot start or end a name with a space
    - You cannot end a name with a period
    - You cannot used a reserved name, such as COM1, LPT1, or NUL

  name: PasswordAutolockExcludeDomain
  description: |+
    Specifies a list of domain names in fully qualified domain name (FQDN) format whose clients are to be exempted from the password policy.
    If the **RequirePasswordAutoLock** property on the sync share is false, then this parameter has no effect.
    If **RequirePasswordAutoLock** is true, clients that are members of the specified domains are not requested by work folders to enforce password length and lock policies on the device.
    It is assumed that their security is managed by the Group Policy of their domain.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Path
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the full path of a folder on an NTFS volume to use for the Sync Share.
    This is the folder that acts as the parent to the user folders.
    You can specify the path with a drive letter or Universal Naming Convention (UNC) format, but the path must be local to the server or failover cluster.
    You cannot create a sync share inside another sync share, and the path cannot contain any mount points.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "2"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RequireEncryption
  description: |+
    Indicates whether the Sync Server requests that the contents of work folders be encrypted on each PC and device that accesses the Sync Share.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RequirePasswordAutoLock
  description: |+
    Indicates whether the device must meet the following policies: 

    - Password minimum length of six characters
    - Lock screen activates after a maximum of 15 minutes
    - User account lockout after a maximum of 10 failed sign-in attempts

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ThrottleLimit
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
    If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
    The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Type
  description: |+
    Specifies the type of the Sync Share.
    By default, all shares are of type User Data, and you should not change this value.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "3"
  aliases: AllowedAccount, AllowedUser
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: UserFolderName
  description: |+
    Specifies a folder-naming format for the user folder on the Sync Share.
    To maintain compatibility with existing user folders that use aliases for their names, specify \[user\], which is required, or omit this parameter.
    To eliminate conflicts between identical user aliases in different domains, specify \[user\]@\[domain\].
    You can also specify a relative path under the sync share root; for example, UserData\\\[user\].

    Sync share creates each user folder during the first sync operation, if it doesn't already exist.
    If the user folder exists, confirm that the user has Read/Write or Full Control permissions and is the owner of their folder, unless the folder is owned by an Administrators group.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
