  The **Invoke-TroubleshootingPack** cmdlet runs a troubleshooting pack in either interactive or unattended mode.
  A troubleshooting pack determines the root causes of issues, resolves the issues, and verifies that the issues were resolved.
  The cmdlet can save reports that detail issues and resolutions.

  In interactive mode, you can select the resolutions to use and provide input to interactions with the troubleshooting pack.
  In unattended mode, the troubleshooting pack determines which resolutions to use at run time.
  While in unattended mode, if the troubleshooting pack requires input, you need to provide answers or specify an answer file.
  To create an answer file, use the **Get-TroubleshootingPack** cmdlet.

  You can save the result report and the debug report, along with XSL and any linked files.
  Both reports contain the issues and resolutions.
  The debug report contains additional information.
