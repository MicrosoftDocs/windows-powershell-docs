    This cmdlet returns a **TpmProvisioningObject** object that includes the following information:

    - TpmReady. Whether the TPM is complies with latest Windows standards.
    - RestartRequired. Whether the computer requires a restart to continue the provisioning process.
    - ShutdownRequired. Whether the computer must be shut down to continue the provisioning process.
    - ClearRequired. If this has a value of True, you must import an owner authorization value or remove the owner authorization value. 
    - PhysicalPresenceRequired. Whether a person must be at the computer during restart to continue the provisioning process.

    TpmReady                 : False

    This command initializes a TPM.
    The *AllowClear* parameter means that a TPM owner authorization value stored in the registry is used to clear the TPM if the TPM is configured to accept TPM_OwnerClear commands. 
    The *AllowPhysicalPresence* parameter means that the cmdlet is allowed to issue a clear request which must be confirmed by a physical present user during the next restart.

    The cmdlet returns an object with information about the state of the provisioning process.

  The **Initialize-Tpm** cmdlet performs part of the provisioning process for a Trusted Platform Module (TPM).
  Provisioning is the process of preparing a TPM to be used.
  You may need to perform other steps to fully provision a TPM.
