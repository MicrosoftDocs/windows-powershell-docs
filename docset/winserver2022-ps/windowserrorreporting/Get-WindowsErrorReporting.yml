  The **Get-WindowsErrorReporting** cmdlet retrieves the Windows Error Reporting (WER) status for the server.

  Windows Error Reporting is a flexible feedback infrastructure that gathers information about hardware and software problems, reports the information to Microsoft, and gives users any available solutions.
  Windows Error Reporting generates reports in response to system events, such as application crashes or kernel faults.

  Use [Enable-WindowsErrorReporting](./Enable-WindowsErrorReporting.yml) to enable Windows Error Reporting.
  After you enable it, WER sends information about application failures to Microsoft.
  Use [Disable-WindowsErrorReporting](./Disable-WindowsErrorReporting.yml) to disable WER.
