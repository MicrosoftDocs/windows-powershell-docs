  The **Add-WBSystemState** cmdlet adds the system state components to a policy contained in the specified **WBPolicy** object.
  Use backups created through this policy to perform a system state recovery.

  The **WBPolicy** object must be in edit mode.
  To put the **WBPolicy** object in edit mode for a policy that is set as the scheduled backup policy, use the [Get-WBPolicy](./Get-WBPolicy.yml) cmdlet with the *Editable* parameter.
  The [New-WBPolicy](./New-WBPolicy.yml) cmdlet creates a new **WBPolicy** object that is already in edit mode.

  To use this cmdlet, you must be a member of the Administrators group or Backup Operators group.
