### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet

  Mounts a volume inside a backup so that you can browse the files on the volume.
module: WindowsServerBackup
notes: ""
inputs:
- name: <xref href="WBBackup, WBVolume" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    You must specify the **WBBackupSet** object that contains the backup set along with the **WBVolume** object that contains the volume inside the backup set.
outputs:
- name: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    This cmdlet returns the mount path for the volume that you back up if the mount is successful.
    You can use the mount path with a dir command to browse the volume or specify the file recovery path as a parameter to the **Start-WBFileRecovery** cmdlet.
    This path is valid for only 10 minutes, and Windows Server® 2012 Backup deletes the mount path after that.
    To continue browsing this path, call the **Get-WBBackupVolumeBrowsePath** cmdlet again with the same parameters within the 10-minute interval to make the path valid again for 10 more minutes, and repeat the process as needed.
