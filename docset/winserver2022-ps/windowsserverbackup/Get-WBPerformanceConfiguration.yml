name: Get-WBPerformanceConfiguration
description: |-
  The **Get-WBPerformanceConfiguration** cmdlet gets the current performance settings for volume backups.
  The settings are applicable only for volume backups; these settings are not applicable for files, folders, system state, or applications.
  The settings apply globally to all volumes in a backup, or to specific volumes.
  The acceptable values for this parameter are:

  - AlwaysFull: The time to create a backup is proportional to the size of volume being backed up.
  This setting applies at a global level for all volumes or for specific volumes. 

  - AlwaysIncremental: Increase the backup speed by just tracking the changes between the last and current backup.
  This option is not recommended for servers with disk-intensive operation which may experience reduced disk throughput on volumes included in the backup.
  This can be set at a global level for all volumes or specific for some volumes. 

  - Custom: This is the global setting reported in case there is a specific volume level setting set.
