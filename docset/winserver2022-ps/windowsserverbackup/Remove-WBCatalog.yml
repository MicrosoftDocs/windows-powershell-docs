  The **Remove-WBCatalog** cmdlet removes the backup catalog from the local computer.
  Use this cmdlet when the backup catalog is corrupted and you cannot restore it by using the [Restore-WBCatalog](./Restore-WBCatalog.yml) cmdlet.

  If you remove the backup catalog for a computer, you cannot access the backups of that computer by using Windows Server Backup.
  In this case, if you can access another backup location, use **Restore-WBCatalog** to restore the backup catalog from that location, and then create a new backup from that backup catalog.
