  The **Remove-WBSystemState** cmdlet removes the system state components from a policy contained in the **WBPolicy** object.
  Depending on what the **WBPolicy** object includes, you may still backup some of the components that are part of the system state, but you may not be able to use the components in a system state recovery.

  The **WBPolicy** object must be in edit mode.
  To put the **WBPolicy** object in edit mode for a policy that is the scheduled backup policy, use the [Get-WBPolicy](./Get-WBPolicy.yml) cmdlet with the *Editable* parameter.
  The [New-WBPolicy](./New-WBPolicy.yml) cmdlet creates a new **WBPolicy** object that is already in edit mode.

  To use this cmdlet, you must be a member of the Administrators group or Backup Operators group.
