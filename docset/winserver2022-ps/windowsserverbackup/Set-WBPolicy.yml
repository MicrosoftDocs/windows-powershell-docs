examples:

  code: |-
    The first command creates a backup policy object and stores it in the $Policy variable.
    PS C:\> $Policy = New-WBPolicy

    The second command creates a file specification object and stores the result in the $FileSpec variable. A file specification determines what items to include or exclude from backups.
    PS C:\> $FileSpec = New-WBFileSpec -FileSpec "C:\dir1"

    The third command adds a Windows Backup file specification to the backup policy.
    PS C:\> Add-WBFileSpec -Policy $Policy -FileSpec $FileSpec

    The fourth command adds bare metal recovery to the policy.
    PS C:\> Add-WBBareMetalRecovery $Policy

    The fifth command gets the Windows Backup disk configuration. This cmdlet gets the list of internal and external disks available for the local computer and stores the resulting list in the $Disks variable.
    PS C:\> $Disks = Get-WBDisk

    The sixth command creates a backup target object and stores it in the $BackupLocation variable.
    PS C:\> $BackupLocation = New-WBBackupTarget -Disk $Disks[2]

    The seventh command adds a backup target. The $BackupLocation variable specifies the backup locations in the policy.
    PS C:\> Add-WBBackupTarget -Editable -Policy $Policy -Target $BackupLocation 

    The eighth command sets the backup schedule in the policy. The cmdlet sets the times to create daily backups.
    PS C:\> Set-WBSchedule -Policy $Policy 09:00

    The ninth command sets the backup policy object for the computer.
    PS C:\> Set-WBPolicy -Policy $Policy

    This example sets a new backup policy.

- title: 'Example 2: Set backup policy by using a remote shared file'
  code: |-
    The first command gets the backup policy object and stores it in the $Policy variable.
    PS C:\> $Policy = Get-WBPolicy -Editable

    The second command creates a backup target object and stores it in the $BackupLocation variable. When you are prompted, specify the credentials to access the remote shared folder and acknowledge the warning about choosing a remote shared folder as a backup storage location.
    PS C:\> $BackupLocation = New-WBBackupTarget -NetworkPath "\\ContosoSrv\ContosoShared"

    The third command adds a backup target to the policy. The target is the $BackupLocation variable.
    PS C:\> Add-WBBackupTarget -Policy $policy -Target $BackupLocation 

    The fourth command sets backup policy object from the changes to the $Policy variable.
    PS C:\> Set-WBPolicy -Policy $Policy

    This example modifies the backup policy for the set **WBPolicy** object and changes the backup location to a remote file share.
