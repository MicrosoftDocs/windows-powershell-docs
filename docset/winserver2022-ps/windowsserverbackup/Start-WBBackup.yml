  Starts a one-time backup operation.
module: WindowsServerBackup
notes: ""
inputs:
- name: <xref href="WBPolicy" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    This cmdlet uses a **WBPolicy** object to determine what to include in the backup and where to store the backup.
outputs:
- name: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    If you do not specify the *Async* parameter, this cmdlet displays status messages from the currently running backup as strings.

examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Start a backup by using new settings'
  code: |-
    The first command creates a new backup policy object and stores it in a variable named $Policy.
    PS C:\> $Policy = New-WBPolicy

    The next command creates a backup source, adds the file named C:\15-12-08_1645.jpg to the backup source, and stores the backup source in a variable named $FileSpec.
    PS C:\> $FileSpec = New-WBFileSpec -FileSpec "C:\15-12-08_1645.jpg"

    This command associates the backup source in the $FileSpec variable with the backup policy in the $Policy variable.
    PS C:\> Add-WBFileSpec -Policy $Policy -FileSpec $FileSpec

    This command stores the volume that has the drive letter F: in the variable named $Volume.
    PS C:\> $Volume = Get-WBVolume -VolumePath "F:"

    This command stores the volume in the $Volume variable in the backup policy in the $Policy variable.
    PS C:\> Add-WBVolume -Policy $Policy -Volume $Volume

    This command adds the current system state options to the backup policy in the $Policy variable.
    PS C:\> Add-WBSystemState $Policy

    This command adds the ability to perform a bare-metal recovery to the backup policy in the $Policy variable.
    PS C:\> Add-WBBareMetalRecovery $Policy

    This command creates a new backup location object that contains the volume that has the drive letter D: and then stores that object in the $BackupLocation variable.
    PS C:\> $BackupLocation = New-WBBackupTarget -VolumePath "D:"

    This command adds the backup target based on the backup policy in the $Policy variable and the backup location in the $BackupLocation variable.
    PS C:\> Add-WBBackupTarget -Policy $Policy -Target $BackupLocation

    This command specifies that the backup policy in the $Policy variable uses Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) copy backups.
    PS C:\> Set-WBVssBackupOptions -Policy $Policy -VssCopyBackup

    This command starts the backup by using the backup policy in the $Policy variable.
    PS C:\> Start-WBBackup -Policy $Policy

  code: |-
    PS C:\> $Policy = Get-WBPolicy
    PS C:\> Start-WBBackup -Policy $Policy -Async
    PS C:\> $BackupJob = Get-WBJob
  description: |-
    This example starts a backup by using the settings for scheduled backups defined in a backup policy.

    The first command gets the current backup policy and stores it in the variable named $Policy.

    The second command starts the backup.
    Because the command specifies the *Async* parameter, the cmdlet returns immediately.

    The third command gets the backup status and stores it in the variable named $BackupJob.
    Because the second command includes the *Async*  parameter, you can view the backup status by using the Get-WBJob cmdlet.

uid: WindowsServerBackup.Start-WBBackup
name: Start-WBBackup
description: |-
  The **Start-WBBackup** cmdlet starts a one-time backup operation.

  You can use the settings from an existing backup policy for the scheduled backup by specifying a **WBPolicy** object, or you can start a backup by using new settings.
  If you use new settings to create a backup, you must do the following:

  - Specify the items to include in the backup by using the [Add-WBVolume](./Add-WBVolume.yml), [Add-WBFileSpec](./Add-WBFileSpec.yml), [Add-WBSystemState](./Add-WBSystemState.yml), and [Add-WBBareMetalRecovery](./Add-WBBareMetalRecovery.yml) cmdlets.
  - Specify the location for backup storage by using the locations already defined in a **WBBackupTarget** object or by updating an object of that type.

  Before you can add a backup target to a **WBPolicy** object, put the **WBPolicy** object in edit mode.
  To put the **WBPolicy** object in edit mode for a policy that you have set as the scheduled backup policy, use the Get-WBPolicy cmdlet with the *Editable* parameter.
  The [Get-WBPolicy](./Get-WBPolicy.yml) cmdlet creates a new **WBPolicy** object that is already in edit mode.

  To use this cmdlet, you must be a member of the Administrators group or Backup Operators group.
