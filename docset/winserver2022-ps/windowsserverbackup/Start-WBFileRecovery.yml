### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Starts a file recovery operation.
module: WindowsServerBackup
notes: ""
inputs:
- name: <xref href="WBBackupSet, WBFileRecoveryOptions" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    The file recovery process specifies a backup set object that contains the backup set from which you recover files.
    The recovery process uses file recovery options when you recover files to their original locations and the file that you recover is already present in the original location.
outputs:
- name: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    If you do not specify the *Async* parameter, the recovery operation displays status messages at periodic intervals until the recovery is complete.
    While the recovery operation runs you can use the **Get-WBJob** cmdlet to get the status of the operation.
    After the operation is complete, you can use the `Get-WBJob -Previous 1` command to get the completed recovery status.

examples:
- title: Example 1 :Recover files to their original location
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Start-WBFileRecovery -BackupSet $Backup -FilePathToRecover "C:\Dir1" -Recursive -FileRecoveryOption CreateCopyIfExists -Force
    Recovering files from C:\Dir1 : 
    Completed.
  description: |-
    This command recovers the file at the path C:\Dir1 from the backup set named $Backup and restores it to its original location.
    Because the command includes the *Force* parameter, the backup proceeds without confirmation prompts.

    Recovering files from C:\Dir1\File1.txt : 
    Completed.
  description: |-
    This example recovers the file named C:\Dir1\File1.txt to the alternate location F:\Dir1.

    The first command uses the **Get-WBBackupVolumeBrowsePath** cmdlet to get the volume browse path for the file that you recover.
    The first element of the Volume array within the backup set stored in the variable named $Backup specifies the volume from which to obtain the backup files.

    The second command checks the path that you obtained from the first command for a file named File1.txt.

    The third command restores the file named File1.txt to the path F:\Dir1.

    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - **SkipIfExists**: Causes Windows Server Backup to skip the existing file and continue with recovery of the next file.
