    This example recovers a virtual machine to its original location.

    The first command gets the backup set object from the system catalog and stores it in the variable named $Backup.

    The second command uses the backup set stored in $Backup to recover a virtual machine that has the ID 285CEA9B-E337-44E1-9BF9-BF431BC3EB35 to its original location.
