## DESCRIPTION
The **Add-DhcpServerv4Failover** cmdlet adds a new IPv4 failover relationship to a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server service.
You can add a failover relationship with load balance mode or in hot-standby mode.

This cmdlet creates the failover relationship on both of the DHCP server services that use the specified parameters.
The *ScopeId* parameter value specified on the source DHCP server service, or local computer that runs the DHCP server service is identically setup on the partner DHCP server service.

If the *SharedSecret* parameter is specified, message digest authentication will be automatically turned on for the newly created failover relationship.

By default, user confirmation will be sought if the *SharedSecret* parameter is specified.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Create an active-active failover relationship
```
PS C:\> Add-DhcpServerv4Failover -ComputerName "dhcpserver.contoso.com" -Name "SFO-SIN-Failover" -PartnerServer "dhcpserver2.contoso.com" -ScopeId 10.10.10.0,10.20.20.0 -SharedSecret "sEcReT"
```

This example creates a load balance, or active-active, failover relationship between the DHCP server services that runs on the computers named dhcpserver.contoso.com and dhcpserver2.contoso.com with the scopes 10.10.10.0 and 10.20.20.0 present on the DHCP server service that runs on  the computer named dhcpserver.contoso.com added to the failover relationship.
These scopes will be created on the partner DHCP server service that runs on the computer named dhcpserver2.contoso.com as part of the failover relationship creation.
Message authentication is enabled for the server-to-server message exchange with the specified shared secret.

### Example 2: Create an active-passive failover relationship
```
PS C:\> Add-DhcpServerv4Failover -ComputerName "dhcpserver.contoso.com" -Name "SFO-SIN-Failover" -PartnerServer "dhcpserver2.contoso.com" -ServerRole Standby -ScopeId 10.10.10.0,10.20.20.0
```

This example creates a hot standby, or active-passive, failover relationship between the DHCP server services that runs on the computers named dhcpserver.contoso.com and dhcpserver2.contoso.com with the scopes 10.10.10.0 and 10.20.20.0 present on the DHCP server service that runs on the computer named dhcpserver.contoso.com added to the failover relationship.
These scopes will be created on the partner DHCP server service that runs on the computer named dhcpserver2.contoso.com as part of the failover relationship creation.
The DHCP server service that runs on the computer named dhcpserver.contoso.com will be the standby DHCP server service and the DHCP server service that runs on the computer named dhcpserver2.contoso.com will be the active DHCP server service in the failover relationship.

### Example 3: Create an active-active failover relationship with specified load balance amount
```
PS C:\> Add-DhcpServerv4Failover -ComputerName "dhcpserver.contoso.com" -Name "SFO-SIN-Failover" -PartnerServer "dhcpserver2.contoso.com" -ScopeId 10.10.10.0,10.20.20.0 -LoadBalancePercent 70 -MaxClientLeadTime 2:00:00 -AutoStateTransition $True -StateSwitchInterval 2:00:00
```

This example creates a load balance, or active-active, failover relationship between the DHCP server services that runs on the computer named dhcpserver.contoso.com and dhcpserver2.contoso.com with the scopes 10.10.10.0 and 10.20.20.0 present on the DHCP server service that runs on the computer named dhcpserver.contoso.com added to the failover relationship.
These scopes will be created on the partner DHCP server service that runs on the computer named dhcpserver2.contoso.com as part of the failover relationship creation.
70% of the client requests will be served by DHCP server service that runs on the computer named dhcpserver.contoso.com and 30% by the DHCP server service that runs on the computer named dhcpserver2.contoso.com.
The maximum client lead time for the failover relationship is set to 2 hours.
The automatic state transition from the COMMUNICATION INTERRUPTED state to the PARTNER DOWN state is turned on and the timer for automatic state transition is set to 2 hours.

### Example 4: Create an active-passive failover relationship with reserve
```
PS C:\> Add-DhcpServerv4Failover -ComputerName "dhcpserver.contoso.com" -Name "SFO-SIN-Failover" -PartnerServer "dhcpserver2.contoso.com" -ScopeId 10.10.10.0,10.20.20.0 -ReservePercent 10 -MaxClientLeadTime 2:00:00 -AutoStateTransition $True -StateSwitchInterval 2:00:00
```

This example creates a hot standby, or active-passive, failover relationship between the DHCP server service that runs on the computer named dhcpserver.contoso.com and dhcpserver2.contoso.com with the scopes 10.10.10.0 and 10.20.20.0 present on the DHCP server service that runs on the computer named dhcpserver.contoso.com added to the failover relationship.
These scopes will be created on the partner DHCP server service that runs on the computer named dhcpserver2.contoso.com as part of the failover relationship creation.
The DHCP server service that runs on the computer named dhcpserver2.contoso.com will be standby DHCP server service and the DHCP server service that runs on the computer named dhcpserver.contoso.com will be the active DHCP server service in the failover relationship.
10% of the free IP addresses in the scopes will be reserved for the standby DHCP server service.
The maximum client lead time for the failover relationship is set to 2 hours.
The automatic state transition from the COMMUNICATED INTERUPTED state to the PARTNER DOWN state is turned on and the timer for automatic state transition is set to 2 hours.

## PARAMETERS

### -AsJob
Runs the cmdlet as a background job.
Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete.
The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt.
You can continue to work in the session while the job completes.
To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets.
To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet.
For more information about Windows PowerShellÂ® background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).
