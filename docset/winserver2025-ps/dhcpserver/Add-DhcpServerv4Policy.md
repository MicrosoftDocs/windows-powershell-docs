## SYNTAX

```
Add-DhcpServerv4Policy [-ComputerName <String>] [-Name] <String> [-Condition] <String> [-Description <String>]
 [-ScopeId <IPAddress>] [-ProcessingOrder <UInt16>] [-RelayAgent <String[]>] [-RemoteId <String[]>]
 [-SubscriberId <String[]>] [-PassThru] [-LeaseDuration <TimeSpan>] [-Fqdn <String[]>] [-Enabled <Boolean>]
 [-VendorClass <String[]>] [-UserClass <String[]>] [-MacAddress <String[]>] [-CircuitId <String[]>]

```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Add-DhcpServerv4Policy** cmdlet adds a new policy either at the server level or at the scope level.
The policy name must be unique at the level, either server or specific scope, where the policy is added and should have at least one condition as specified by the *CircuitId*, *ClientId*, *Fqdn*, *MACAddress*, *RelayAgent*, *RemoteId*, *SubscriberId*, *UserClass*, or *VendorClass* parameter.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Create a server level policy for virtual machine clients
```
PS C:\> Add-DhcpServerv4Policy -Name "HyperVPolicy" -Condition OR -MacAddress EQ,00155D*,000569*
```

This example creates a server level policy for virtual machine clients.
The MAC addresses of Hyper-V virtual machines (00-15-5D) and VMWare virtual machines (00-05-69) are used as a condition in the policy.

### Example 2: Create a server level policy for non-virtual machine clients
```
PS C:\> Add-DhcpServerv4Policy -Name "PhysicalComputersPolicy" -Condition OR -MacAddress NE,00155D*,000569*
```

This example creates a server level policy for non-virtual machine clients.
The MAC address of Hyper-V virtual machines (00-15-5D) and VMware virtual machines (000569) is used as a negation condition in the policy.

### Example 3: Create a scope level policy for virtual machine clients
```
PS C:\> Add-DhcpServerv4Policy -Name "VMPolicy" -ScopeId 10.10.10.0 -Condition OR -MacAddress EQ,00155D*,000569*
```

This example creates a scope level policy for virtual machine clients inside the scope 10.10.10.0.
The MAC addresses of Hyper-V virtual machines (00-15-5D) and VMware virtual machines (00-05-69) are used as a condition in the policy.

### Example 4: Create a printer policy in a scope based on a vendor class
```
PS C:\> Add-DhcpServerv4Policy -Name "PrinterPolicy" -ScopeId 10.10.10.0 -Condition OR -VendorClass EQ,"HP Printer","Xerox Printer"
```

This example creates a printer policy inside the scope 10.10.10.0 based on the vendor class of printers.
The vendor classes must be defined before they are used in the policy.

### Example 5: Create a printer policy in a scope based on a user class
```
PS C:\> Add-DhcpServerv4Policy -Name "LabComputerPolicy" -ScopeId 10.10.10.0 -Condition OR -UserClass EQ,LabComputers
```

This example creates a lab computers policy inside the scope 10.10.10.0 based on the user class.
The user class must be defined before they are used in the policy.

### Example 6: Create a policy based on the relay agent information inside a scope
```
PS C:\> Add-DhcpServerv4Policy -Name "RelayAgentBasedPolicy" -ScopeId 10.10.10.0 -Condition OR -RelayAgent EQ,01030a0b0c02050000000123
```

This example creates a policy based on the relay agent information (option 82) inside the scope 10.10.10.0.
The DHCP relay agent must be configured to use the relay agent information option (option 82).

### Example 7: Create a policy by combining conditions based on a MAC address prefix and vendor class
```
PS C:\> Add-DhcpServerv4Policy -Name "DevicesPolicy" -ScopeId 10.10.10.0 -Condition OR -MacAddress EQ,F8DB7F* -VendorClass EQ,Android
```

This example creates a policy by combining conditions, using OR, based on MAC address prefix of HTC phone devices and vendor class of Android, inside the scope 10.10.10.0.
The vendor class must be defined before it is used in the policy.

### Example 8: Create a server level policy for virtual machine clients, assign a processing order
```
PS C:\> Add-DhcpServerv4Policy -Name "HyperVPolicy" -Condition OR -MacAddress EQ,00155D*,000569* -ProcessingOrder 2 -Enabled $False
```

This example creates a server level policy for virtual machine clients and assigns a processing order of 2 and creates the policy in a disabled state.
The MAC addresses of Hyper-V virtual machines (00-15-5D) and VMWare virtual machines (00-05-69) are used as a condition in the policy.

### Example 9: Create a policy by combining conditions based on a MAC address prefix and vendor class with lease duration
```
PS C:\> Add-DhcpServerv4Policy -Name "DevicesPolicy" -Condition OR -LeaseDuration 10 -MacAddress EQ,F8DB7F -ScopeId 10.10.10.0 -VendorClass "EQ","Android"
```

This example creates a policy by combining conditions, using OR, based on MAC address prefix of HTC phone devices and vendor class of Android, inside the scope 10.10.10.0.
The vendor class must be defined before it is used in the policy.
In addition, the command sets the lease duration for the clients to 10 days.

### Example 10: Create a server level policy for workgroup joined clients
```
PS C:\> Add-DhcpServerv4Policy -Name "WorkgroupDevices" -Condition OR -Fqdn "Isl"
```

This example creates a server level policy for workgroup joined clients.
The policy matches clients that have a single label FQDN in the conditions in the policy.

### Example 11: Create a server level policy for clients that are not members of a domain
```
PS C:\> Add-DhcpServerv4Policy -Name "ForeignDevices" -Condition OR -Fqdn NE,*.contoso.com
```

This example creates a server level policy for all foreign clients that are not members of the local domain contoso.com.
The policy matches clients that have an FQDN that does not contain the value contoso.com.

## PARAMETERS

### -AsJob
Runs the cmdlet as a background job.
Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete.
The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt.
You can continue to work in the session while the job completes.
To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets.
To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet.
For more information about Windows PowerShellÂ® background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).
