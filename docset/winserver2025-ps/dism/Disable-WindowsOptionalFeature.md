# Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature

## SYNOPSIS
Disables a feature in a Windows image.

## SYNTAX

### Online
```
Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName <String[]> [-PackageName <String>] [-Remove] [-NoRestart] [-Online]
 [-WindowsDirectory <String>] [-SystemDrive <String>] [-LogPath <String>] [-ScratchDirectory <String>]
 [-LogLevel <LogLevel>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Offline
```
Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName <String[]> [-PackageName <String>] [-Remove] [-NoRestart]
 -Path <String> [-WindowsDirectory <String>] [-SystemDrive <String>] [-LogPath <String>]
 [-ScratchDirectory <String>] [-LogLevel <LogLevel>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature** cmdlet disables or removes an optional feature in a Windows image.

Use the *Online* parameter to specify the running operating system on your local computer, or use the *Path* parameter to specify the location of a mounted Windows image.

The *PackageName* parameter specifies the package that the feature is a component of.
This parameter is optional when the package is the Windows Foundation package.

The *FeatureName* parameter specifies the feature to remove.
You can specify more than one feature in the same package.
Separate feature names with a comma.

The *Remove* parameter removes the files for an optional feature without removing the feature's manifest from the image.
You can use *Remove* to reduce the disk space that is used by a Windows image.
After the image has been installed, you can restore the feature at any time from a remote source such as Windows Update or a network share.
For more information about Features on Demand, see [Configure a Windows Repair Source](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=243077) in the TechNet Library.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Disable an optional feature
```
PS C:\> Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName "Hearts"
```

This command disables an optional feature, Hearts, from the running Windows operating system.

### Example 2: Disable a feature in an image
```
PS C:\> Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Path "c:\offline" -FeatureName "Calc" -PackageName "Microsoft.Windows.Calc.Demo~6595b6144ccf1df~x86~en~1.0.0.0" -Remove
```

This command disables the optional feature, Calc, in the specified package in the Windows image that is mounted to c:\offline.
It also removes all of the files except the manifest file, which reduces the size of the Windows image.
The feature can be restored with the **Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature** cmdlet or by using Features on Demand at any time after the image is deployed.

## PARAMETERS

### -FeatureName
Specifies the name of the feature to be disabled.
Feature names are case sensitive if you are servicing a Windows image other than WindowsÂ® 8 or a later version.
You can use Get-WindowsOptionalFeature to find the name of the feature in the image.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -LogLevel
Specifies the maximum output level shown in the logs.
The default log level is 3.
The accepted values are as follows:
- 1 = Errors only
- 2 = Errors and warnings
- 3 = Errors, warnings, and information
- 4 = All of the information listed previously, plus debug output

```yaml
Type: LogLevel
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: LL
Accepted values: Errors, Warnings, WarningsInfo

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -LogPath
Specifies the full path and file name to log to.
If not set, the default is `%WINDIR%\Logs\Dism\dism.log`.
In Windows PE, the default directory is the RAMDISK scratch space which can be as low as 32 MB.
The log file will automatically be archived.
The archived log file will be saved with .bak appended to the file name and a new log file will be generated.
Each time the log file is archived the .bak file will be overwritten.
When using a network share that is not joined to a domain, use the net use command together with domain credentials to set access permissions before you set the log path for the DISM log.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: LP

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -NoRestart
Suppresses reboot.
If a reboot is not required, this command does nothing.
This option will keep the application from prompting for a restart or keep it from restarting automatically.

```yaml

Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None

Parameter Sets: Offline
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False

You can use *Remove* to reduce the disk space that is used by a Windows image.
After the image has been installed, you can restore the feature at any time from a remote source such as Windows Update or a network share.

Remove can only be used when servicing an image contain Windows 8 or Windows Server 2012 or a later version.

> [!NOTE]
> Starting with Windows 10, the payload is not removed from Windows 10 devices in order to support Push-Button Reset. However, the payload is removed from editions of Windows Server.

Items in the scratch directory are deleted after each operation.
You should not use a network share location as a scratch directory to expand a package (.cab or .msu file) for installation.
The directory used for extracting files for temporary usage during servicing should be a local directory.

```yaml

Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SystemDrive
Specifies the path to the location of the BootMgr files.
This is necessary only when the BootMgr files are located on a partition other than the one that you are running the command from.
Use -SystemDrive to service an installed Windows image from a Windows PE environment.

Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
