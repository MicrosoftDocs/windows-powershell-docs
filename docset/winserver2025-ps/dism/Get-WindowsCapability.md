# Get-WindowsCapability

## SYNOPSIS
Gets Windows capabilities for an image or a running operating system.

## SYNTAX

### Offline
```
Get-WindowsCapability [-Name <String>] [-LimitAccess] [-Source <String[]>] -Path <String>
 [-WindowsDirectory <String>] [-SystemDrive <String>] [-LogPath <String>] [-ScratchDirectory <String>]
 [-LogLevel <LogLevel>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Online
```
Get-WindowsCapability [-Name <String>] [-LimitAccess] [-Source <String[]>] [-Online]
 [-WindowsDirectory <String>] [-SystemDrive <String>] [-LogPath <String>] [-ScratchDirectory <String>]
 [-LogLevel <LogLevel>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Get-WindowsCapability** cmdlet gets Windows capabilities installed in an image or running operating system, or available for installation from a remote source.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Get the Windows capabilities for an image
```
PS C:\> Get-WindowsCapability -Path "C:\offline" -Name "Language.TextToSpeech~~~fr-FR~0.0.1.0"
```

This command gets the Windows capabilities installed in the operating system image specified by the *Name* parameter at the path C:\offline.

### Example 2: Get the Windows capabilities for the local operating system
```
PS C:\> Get-WindowsCapability -Online
```

This command gets the Windows capabilities installed on the local host.

## PARAMETERS

### -LimitAccess
Prevents DISM from contacting Windows Update or Windows Server Update for the capability source files.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -LogLevel
Specifies the maximum output level shown in the logs.
The default log level is 3.
The accepted values are as follows:
- 1 = Errors only
- 2 = Errors and warnings
- 3 = Errors, warnings, and information
- 4 = All of the information listed previously, plus debug output

```yaml
Type: LogLevel
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: LL
Accepted values: Errors, Warnings, WarningsInfo

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -LogPath
Specifies the full path and file name to log to.
If not set, the default is `%WINDIR%\Logs\Dism\dism.log`.
In Windows PE, the default directory is the RAMDISK scratch space which can be as low as 32 MB.
The log file will automatically be archived.
The archived log file will be saved with .bak appended to the file name and a new log file will be generated.
Each time the log file is archived the .bak file will be overwritten.
When using a network share that is not joined to a domain, use the net use command together with domain credentials to set access permissions before you set the log path for the DISM log.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: LP

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Name
Specifies the identity of the capability in an operating system image to get.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Online
Indicates that the cmdlet operates on a running operating system on the local host.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: Online
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Path
Specifies the full path to the root directory of the offline Windows image that you will service.
If the directory named Windows is not a subdirectory of the root directory, *WindowsDirectory* must be specified.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: Offline
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ScratchDirectory
Specifies a temporary directory that will be used when extracting files for use during servicing.
The directory must exist locally.
If not specified, the `\Windows\%Temp%` directory will be used, with a subdirectory name of a randomly generated hexadecimal value for each run of DISM.
Items in the scratch directory are deleted after each operation.
You should not use a network share location as a scratch directory to expand a package (.cab or .msu file) for installation.
The directory used for extracting files for temporary usage during servicing should be a local directory.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Source
Allows you to check the capabilities that are installable from a location that contains packages
used to install capabilities, such as a FOD repository. Multiple **Source** arguments can be used.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SystemDrive
Specifies the path to the location of the BootMgr files.
This is necessary only when the BootMgr files are located on a partition other than the one that you are running the command from.
Use -SystemDrive to service an installed Windows image from a Windows PE environment.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WindowsDirectory
Specifies the path to the Windows directory relative to the image path.
This cannot be the full path to the Windows directory; it should be a relative path.
If not specified, the default is the Windows directory in the root of the offline image directory.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters
This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable.
