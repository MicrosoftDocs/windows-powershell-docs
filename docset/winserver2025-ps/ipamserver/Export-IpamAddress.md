# Export-IpamAddress

## SYNOPSIS
Exports IP addresses from IPAM.

## SYNTAX

```
Export-IpamAddress -AddressFamily <AddressFamily> [-NetworkType <VirtualizationType>] [-Path <String>]
 [-PassThru] [-Force] [-CimSession <CimSession[]>] [-ThrottleLimit <Int32>] [-AsJob] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Export-IpamAddress** cmdlet exports all of the IP addresses from an address family in IP Address Management (IPAM).
The cmdlet exports the IP addresses as a comma-separated value (CSV) file.

The field header names and the enumerated values of IP address objects that this cmdlet exports have English names that are culture-independent (invariant) and are not in the localized language that the server uses.
The field header names follow the Windows PowerShell property naming conventions.
The format of date and time values of the exported objects are in the localized format of the computer that runs the IPAM server and not in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

The IPAM client console and IPAM Server cmdlets in Windows PowerShell support interoperability between import and export functionality of English and localized CSV files, provided that the language and locale of the computers that run the IPAM server that import and export IP addresses are the same.
You can import a localized CSV file that you export from a computer that runs the IPAM client UI by using IPAM Windows PowerShell.
You can import an English CSV file that you exported by using IPAM Windows PowerShell from a computer that runs the IPAM client provided the language and locale of the computers that run the IPAM client and IPAM server are the same.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Export all IPv4 addresses
```
PS C:\> Export-IpamAddress -AddressFamily IPv4 -Path "C:\Addresses_v4.csv"
```

This command exports all the IPv4 addresses in the IPAM server to the specified path.

### Example 2: Export all IPv6 addresses
```
PS C:\> Export-IpamAddress -AddressFamily IPv6 -Path "C:\addresses_v6.csv" -Force
```

This command exports all the IPv6 addresses in IPAM to the specified path.
The command overwrites the file without prompting the user if it already exists.

### Example 3: Output all IPv4 addresses
```
PS C:\> Export-IpamAddress -AddressFamily IPv4 -PassThru
IPAddress       IPAddressState    AssignmentType   ManagedByService    ServiceInstance
---------       --------------    --------------   ----------------    ---------------
172.22.2.15     In-Use            Static           IPAM                Localhost
10.10.0.10      In-Use            Static           IPAM                Localhost
172.17.14.15    Reserved          Dynamic          MS DHCP             s2-infra.contoso.com
192.168.0.1     Reserved          Dynamic          MS DHCP             s2-infra.contoso.com
```

This command outputs all the IPv4 address objects in IPAM.

The command includes the *PassThru* parameter, so it displays results to the console.

### Example 4: Output all expired IPv4 addresses
```
PS C:\> Export-IpamAddress -AddressFamily IPv4 -PassThru | Where-Object -FilterScript { $_.ExpiryStatus -Eq "Expired" }
IPAddress         IPAddressState    AssignmentType   ManagedByService    ServiceInstance
---------         --------------    --------------   ----------------    ---------------
10.155.155.155    In-Use            Static           IPAM                Localhost
```

This command filters and outputs all of the expired IPv4 address in IPAM.

The command includes the *PassThru* parameter, so it displays results to the console.

### Example 5: Export all IPv4 addresses that have expired
```
PS C:\> Export-IpamAddress -AddressFamily IPv4 -PassThru | Where-Object -FilterScript { $_.ExpiryStatus -Eq "Expired" } | Export-Csv -Path "C:\expired.csv"
```

This command filters and exports all the expired IPv4 addresses in IPAM to the specified path.

The command includes the *PassThru* parameter, so it displays results to the console.

### Example 6: Export and output all IPv4 addresses that have expired
```
PS C:\> Export-IpamAddress -AddressFamily IPv4 -Path "C:\Addresses.csv" -PassThru
IPAddress       IPAddressState    AssignmentType   ManagedByService    ServiceInstance
---------       --------------    --------------   ----------------    ---------------
172.22.2.15     In-Use            Static           IPAM                Localhost
10.10.0.10      In-Use            Static           IPAM                Localhost
172.17.14.15    Reserved          Dynamic          MS DHCP             s2-infra.contoso.com
192.168.0.1     Reserved          Dynamic          MS DHCP             s2-infra.contoso.com
```

This command exports all of the IPv4 Addresses in IPAM to the specified path and then outputs the exported addresses.

The command includes the *PassThru* parameter, so it displays results to the console.

## PARAMETERS

### -AddressFamily
Specifies an address family of IP addresses.The acceptable values for this parameter are:

- IPv4
- IPv6

```yaml
Type: AddressFamily
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Accepted values: IPv4, IPv6

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AsJob
Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete.

The cmdlet immediately returns an object that represents the job and then displays the command prompt.
You can continue to work in the session while the job completes.
To manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets.
To get the job results, use the [Receive-Job](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113372) cmdlet.

For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113251).

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -CimSession
Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
The default is the current session on the local computer.

```yaml
Type: CimSession[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: Session

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Force

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -NetworkType
Specifies an IPv4 or IPv6 network prefix, in Classless InterDomain Routing (CIDR) notation.
This parameter specifies the IP subnet of the IP address range for which to import the addresses.

```yaml
Type: VirtualizationType
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Accepted values: NonVirtualized, Provider, Customer

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

Returns an object representing the item with which you are working.
By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Path

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ThrottleLimit
Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
