## DESCRIPTION
The **Disable-NetAdapterPowerManagement** cmdlet disables specific power management features on a network adapter.
If no power parameters are specified then all power management features are disabled.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Disable power management on a specified network adapter
```
PS C:\> Disable-NetAdapterPowerManagement -Name "Ethernet 1"
```

This command disables power management on the network adapter named Ethernet 1 and restarts the network adapter.

### Example 2: Disable power management on a specified network adapter using InputObject
```
PS C:\> $NetAdapter1 = Get-NetAdapter -Name "Ethernet 3"
PS C:\> Disable-NetAdapterPowerManagement -InputObject $NetAdapter1
```

This first command gets the network adapter named Ethernet 3 and stores the result in the variable named $NetAdapter1.

The second command disables the network adapter that is in the $NetAdapter1 variable.

### Example 3: Disable power management on the specified network adapter and do not restart it
```
PS C:\> Disable-NetAdapterPowerManagement -Name "Ethernet 4" -NoRestart
```

This command disables power management on the network adapter named Ethernet 4 and specifies that the network adapter is not restarted.

## PARAMETERS

### -ArpOffload
Indicates that the cmdlet manages the address resolution protocol (ARP) offload capability of the adapter.

The computer, when in low power mode using the ARP offload technology, is able to offload the responsibility of handling responses for incoming ARP protocol requests.

Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -InterfaceDescription
Specifies an array of network adapter interface descriptions.
For a physical network adapter this is typically the name of the vendor of the network adapter followed by a part number and description, such as `Contoso 12345 Gigabit Network Device`.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: ByInstanceID
Aliases: ifDesc, InstanceID

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -NSOffload
Indicates that the cmdlet manages the neighbor solicitation (NS) offload capability of the network adapter.

The computer, when in low power mode using the NS offload technology, is able to offload the handling of responses for incoming NS protocol requests.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False

### -SelectiveSuspend
Indicates that the cmdlet manages the selective suspend capability of the network adapter.

The network drive interface specification (NDIS) selective suspend interface allows NDIS to suspend an idle network adapter by transitioning the adapter to a low-power state.
This enables the computer to reduce the power overhead on the CPU and network adapter.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ThrottleLimit
Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WakeOnMagicPacket
Indicates that the cmdlet manages the wake on magic packet capability of the network adapter.

The magic packet is a broadcast frame containing anywhere within its payload 6 bytes of all 255 (FF FF FF FF FF FF) in hexadecimal), followed by sixteen repetitions of the 48-bit MAC address of the target computer, for a total of 102 bytes.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WakeOnPattern
Indicates that the cmdlet manages the wake on pattern capability of the network adapter.

A wake pattern refers to network packet filters that determine if incoming network traffic should wake the computer.
These patterns can be enabled on the network adapter.

The following wake patterns may be supported by a network adapter:
- Wake Pattern
- Wake on new incoming TCP connection for IPv4 and IPv6 including TCP SYN IPv4 and TCP SYN IPv6.
- 802.1x re-authentication packets
- Bitmapped Patterns.
Most network adapters can be programmed with bit-mapped pattern filters.
Bitmapped patterns are defined by a bit-map mask and a pattern filter.
As a network packet is received, it is masked using the bitmap mask and then compared to the pattern filter.
If there is a match, then the network adapter wakes the computer.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
