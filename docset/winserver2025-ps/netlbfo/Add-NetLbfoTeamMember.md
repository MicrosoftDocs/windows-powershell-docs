## PARAMETERS

### -AdministrativeMode
Specifies the initial role of the new member (network adapter).
The acceptable values for this parameter are:

- Active.
Allows the team member to participate in the NIC team.
- Standby.
Places the member in a standby state where it does not participate in the team.
The team member is automatically moved to the Active state if any other member of the team fails.

By default, the initial role of the team member is Active.

At most one member in a team can be in Standby mode.

```yaml
Type: AdminModes
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: am
Accepted values: Active, Standby

Required: False
Position: 2
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -CimSession
Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
The default is the current session on the local computer.

```yaml
Type: CimSession[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: Session

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

```yaml

Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Name

Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: ifAlias, InterfaceAlias

Required: True

```

### -ThrottleLimit
Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
