## DESCRIPTION
The **Set-NetFirewallRule** cmdlet modifies existing firewall rule properties.
This cmdlet gets one or more firewall rules to be modified with the *Name* parameter (default), the *DisplayName* parameter, or by group association using the *DisplayGroup* or *Group* parameter.
Rules cannot be queried by property in this cmdlet, but the querying can be done by the Get-NetFirewallRule cmdlet and piped into this cmdlet.
The remaining parameters modify the properties of the specified rules.
If the *DisplayGroup* or  *Group* parameter is specified, then all sets associated with the specified group receive the same modifications.

To move a rule to a new GPO, copy the existing rule using the Copy-NetFirewallRule cmdlet with the *NewPolicyStore* parameter, then remove the old rule with this cmdlet.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
PS C:\>Set-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "AllowWeb80" -RemoteAddress "192.168.0.2"
```

This example changes a rule to match a different remote IP address of a web server for which traffic is allowed by a rule.

### EXAMPLE 2
```
PS C:\>Set-NetFirewallRule -DisplayGroup "Windows Firewall Remote Management" -Enabled True


This cmdlet shows an alternate way to enable all of the rules in a predefined group.
PS C:\>Enable-NetFirewallRule -DisplayGroup "Windows Firewall Remote Management"
```

This example enables all of the rules in a predefined group.

### EXAMPLE 3
```
PS C:\>Set-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "AllowMessenger" -Authentication Required -Profile Domain
```

This example changes a rule to require authentication and scopes the rule to apply on the domain profile.
A separate IPsec rule must exist to perform the authentication.

## PARAMETERS

### -Action
Specifies that matching firewall rules of the indicated action are modified.
This parameter specifies the action to take on traffic that matches this rule.
The acceptable values for this parameter are: Allow or Block.

- Allow: Network packets that match all of the criteria specified in this rule are permitted through the firewall.
- Block: Network packets that match all of the criteria specified in this rule are dropped by the firewall.

The default value is Allow.
The OverrideBlockRules field changes an allow rule into an allow bypass rule.

```yaml
Type: Action
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Accepted values: NotConfigured, Allow, Block

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AsJob
Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Authentication
Specifies that authentication is required on firewall rules.
The acceptable values for this parameter are: NotRequired, Required, or NoEncap.

- NotRequired: Any network packet matches this rule, that it is protected by IPsec.
This option is the equivalent of not selecting the allow only secure connections option in the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security MMC snap-in.
- Required: Network packets that are authenticated by IPsec match this rule.
A separate IPsec rule must be created to authenticate the traffic.
This option is the equivalent of the allow only secure connections option in the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security MMC snap-in.
- NoEncap: Network connections that are authenticated, but not encapsulated by Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) or Authentication Header (AH) match this rule.
This option is useful for connections that must be monitored by network equipment, such as intrusion detection systems (IDS), that are not compatible with ESP NULL-protected network packets.
The initial connection is authenticated by IPsec by using AuthIP, but the quick mode SA permits clear-text traffic.
To use this option, you must also configure an IPsec rule that specifies authentication with encapsulation none as a quick mode security method.
In the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), authentication and encryption are combined into one set of radio buttons.
In Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) or Windows PowerShellÂ®, authentication and encryption are given as two separate options.
The default value is Required.
A rule can be queried for this condition, or modified by using the security filter object.
See the Get-NetFirewallSecurityFilter cmdlet for more information.

```yaml
Type: Authentication
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Accepted values: NotRequired, Required, NoEncap

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -CimSession
Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
The default is the current session on the local computer.

```yaml
Type: CimSession[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: Session

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Description
Specifies that matching firewall rules of the indicated description are modified.
Wildcard characters are accepted.
This parameter provides information about the firewall rule.
This parameter specifies the localized, user-facing description of the IPsec rule.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Direction
Specifies that matching firewall rules of the indicated direction are modified.
This parameter specifies which direction of traffic to match with this rule.
The acceptable values for this parameter are: Inbound or Outbound.
The default value is Inbound.

```yaml
Type: Direction
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Accepted values: Inbound, Outbound

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DisplayGroup
Specifies that only matching firewall rules of the indicated group association are modified.
Wildcard characters are accepted.
The *Group* parameter specifies the source string for this parameter.
If the value for this parameter is a localizable string, then the *Group* parameter contains an indirect string.
Rule groups can be used to organize rules by influence and allows batch rule modifications.
Using the Set-NetFirewallRule cmdlet, if the group name is specified for a set of rules or sets, then all of the rules or sets in that group receive the same set of modifications.
It is good practice to specify the *Group* parameter value with a universal and world-ready indirect @FirewallAPI name.
This parameter cannot be specified upon object creation using the New-NetFirewallRule cmdlet, but can be modified using dot-notation and the Set-NetFirewallRule cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: ByDisplayGroup
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DisplayName
Specifies that only matching firewall rules of the indicated display name are modified.
Wildcard characters are accepted.
Specifies the localized, user-facing name of the firewall rule being created.
When creating a rule this parameter is required.
This parameter value is locale-dependent.
If the object is not modified, this parameter value may change in certain circumstances.
When writing scripts in multi-lingual environments, the *Name* parameter should be used instead, where the default value is a randomly assigned value.
This parameter cannot be set to All.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: ByDisplayName
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DynamicTarget
Specifies a dynamic transport.
The cmdlet adds the dynamic transport that you specify as a condition that must be matched for the firewall rule to apply.The acceptable values for this parameter are:

- Any
- ProximityApps
- ProximitySharing
- WifiDirectPrinting
- WifiDirectDisplay
- WifiDirectDevices

The default value is Any.

Some types of dynamic transports, such as proximity sharing, abstract the network layer details.
This means that you cannot use standard network layer conditions, such as protocols and ports, to identify the dynamic transports.

```yaml
Type: DynamicTransport
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: DynamicTransport
Accepted values: Any, ProximityApps, ProximitySharing, WifiDirectPrinting, WifiDirectDisplay, WifiDirectDevices

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -EdgeTraversalPolicy
Specifies that matching firewall rules of the indicated edge traversal policy are modified.
This parameter specifies how this firewall rule will handle edge traversal cases.
Edge traversal allows the computer to accept unsolicited inbound packets that have passed through an edge device, such as a network address translation (NAT) router or firewall.
This option applies to inbound rules only.
The acceptable values for this parameter are: Block, Allow, DeferToUser, or DeferToApp.

- Block: Prevents applications from receiving unsolicited traffic from the Internet through a NAT edge device.
- Allow: Allows applications to receive unsolicited traffic directly from the Internet through a NAT edge device.
- DeferToUser: Allows the user to decide whether to allow unsolicited traffic from the Internet through a NAT edge device when an application requests it.
- DeferToApp: Allows each application to determine whether to allow unsolicited traffic from the Internet through a NAT edge device.

The default value is Block.

```yaml
Type: EdgeTraversal
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Accepted values: Block, Allow, DeferToUser, DeferToApp

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Enabled
Specifies that matching firewall rules of the indicated state are modified.
This parameter specifies that the rule object is administratively enabled or administratively disabled.
The acceptable values for this parameter are:

- True: Specifies the rule is currently enabled.
- False: Specifies the rule is currently disabled.
A disabled rule will not actively modify computer behavior, but the management construct still exists on the computer so it can be re-enabled.

```yaml
Type: Enabled
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Accepted values: True, False

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Encryption
Specifies that encryption in authentication is required on firewall rules.
The authentication is done through a separate IPsec or main mode rule.
The acceptable values for this parameter are: NotRequired, Required, or Dynamic.

- NotRequired: Encryption is not required for authentication.
- Required: Encryption is required for authentication through an IPsec rule.
- Dynamic: Allows computers to dynamically negotiate encryption.

The default value is NotRequired.
A rule can be queried for this condition, or modified by using the security filter object.
See the Get-NetFirewallSecurityFilter cmdlet for more information.

```yaml
Type: Encryption
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Accepted values: NotRequired, Required, Dynamic

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Group
Specifies that only matching firewall rules of the indicated group association are modified.
Wildcard characters are accepted.
This parameter specifies the source string for the *DisplayGroup* parameter.
If the *DisplayGroup* parameter value is a localizable string, then this parameter contains an indirect string.
Rule groups can be used to organize rules by influence and allows batch rule modifications.
Using the Set-NetFirewallRule cmdlets, if the group name is specified for a set of rules or sets, then all of the rules or sets in that group receive the same set of modifications.
It is a good practice to specify this parameter value with a universal and world-ready indirect @FirewallAPI name.
The *DisplayGroup* parameter cannot be specified upon object creation using the New-NetFirewallRule cmdlet, but can be modified using dot-notation and the Set-NetFirewallRule cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: ByGroup
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -IcmpType
Specifies the ICMP type codes.
The key encoding is specified by running the Set-NetFirewallSetting cmdlet with the *KeyEncoding* parameter.
The acceptable values for this parameter are:

- ICMP type code:  0 through 255.
- ICMP type code pairs:  3: 4.
- Keyword: Any.
A rule can be queried for this condition, modified by using the security filter object, or both.
See the Get-NetFirewallPortFilter cmdlet for more information.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -InputObject
Specifies the input object that is used in a pipeline command.

```yaml
Type: CimInstance[]
Parameter Sets: InputObject (cdxml)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -InterfaceAlias
Specifies the alias of the interface that applies to the traffic.
Querying for rules with this parameter can only be performed using filter objects.
See the Get-NetFirewallInterfaceFilter cmdlet for more information.

```yaml
Type: WildcardPattern[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -InterfaceType
Specifies that only network connections made through the indicated interface types are subject to the requirements of this rule.
This parameter specifies different authentication requirements for each of the three main network types.
The acceptable values for this parameter are: Any, Wired, Wireless, or RemoteAccess.

The default value is Any.
Querying for rules with this parameter can only be performed using filter objects.
See the Get-NetFirewallInterfaceTypeFilter cmdlet for more information.

```yaml
Type: InterfaceType
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Accepted values: Any, Wired, Wireless, RemoteAccess

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -LocalAddress
Specifies that network packets with matching IP addresses match this rule.
This parameter value is the first end point of an IPsec rule and specifies the computers that are subject to the requirements of this rule.
This parameter value is an IPv4 or IPv6 address, subnet, range, or the following keyword: Any.
The acceptable formats for this parameter are:
- Single IPv4 Address: 1.2.3.4
- Single IPv6 Address: fe80::1
- IPv4 Subnet (by network bit count): 1.2.3.4/24
- IPv6 Subnet (by network bit count): fe80::1/48
- IPv4 Subnet (by network mask): 1.2.3.4/255.255.255.0
- IPv4 Range: 1.2.3.4 through 1.2.3.7
- IPv6 Range: fe80::1 through fe80::9
Querying for rules with this parameter can only be performed using filter objects.
See the Get-NetFirewallAddressFilter cmdlet for more information.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -LocalOnlyMapping
Indicates that matching firewall rules of the indicated value are modified.
This parameter specifies the firewall rules for local only mapping, which describes whether a packet must pass through a local address on the way to the destination.
Non-TCP traffic is session-less.
Windows Firewall authorizes traffic per session, not per packet, for performance reasons.
Generally, non-TCP sessions are inferred by checking the following fields: local address, remote address, protocol, local port, and remote port.
If this parameter is set to True, then the remote address and port will be ignored when inferring remote sessions.
Sessions will be grouped based on local address, protocol, and local port.
This is similar to the *LooseSourceMapping* parameter, but performs better in cases where the traffic does not need to be filtered by remote address.
This could improve performance on heavy server workloads where UDP requests come from dynamic client ports.
For instance, Teredo relay servers.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -LocalPort
Specifies that network packets with matching IP port numbers match this rule.
This parameter value is the first end point of an IPsec rule.
The acceptable value is a port, range, or keyword and depends on the protocol.
If the *Protocol* parameter value is TCP or UDP, then the acceptable values for this parameter are:
- Port range: 0 through 65535.
- Port number: 80.
- Keyword: Any.
If the *Protocol* parameter value is ICMPv4 or ICMPv6, then the acceptable values for this parameter are:
- An ICMP type, code pair: 0, 8.
- Type and code: 0 through 255.
- Keyword: Any.
If the *Protocol* parameter is not specified, then the acceptable values for this parameter are: Any, RPC, RPC-EPMap, or IPHTTPS.
IPHTTPS is only supported on Windows Server 2012.
Querying for rules with this parameter can only be performed using filter objects.
See the Get-NetFirewallPortFilter cmdlet for more information.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -LocalUser
Specifies the principals to which network traffic this firewall rule applies.
Principals for which the network traffic this firewall rule should apply.
The principals, represented by security identifiers (SIDs) in the security descriptor definition language (SDDL) string, are services, users, application containers, or any SID to which network traffic is associated.
This parameter specifies that only network packets that are authenticated as coming from or going to a principal identified in the list of accounts (SID) match this rule.
Querying for rules with this parameter can only be performed using filter objects.
See the Get-NetFirewallSecurityFilter cmdlet for more information.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -LooseSourceMapping
Indicates that matching firewall rules of the indicated value are modified.
This parameter specifies the firewall rules for loose source mapping, which describes whether a packet can have a non-local source address when being forwarded to a destination.
If this parameter is set to True, then the rule accepts packets incoming from a host other than the one the packets were sent to.
This parameter applies only to UDP protocol traffic.
The default value is False.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: LSM

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Name
Specifies that only matching firewall rules of the indicated name are modified.
Wildcard characters are accepted.
This parameter acts just like a file name, in that only one rule with a given name may exist in a policy store at a time.
During group policy processing and policy merge, rules that have the same name but come from multiple stores being merged, will overwrite one another so that only one exists.
This overwriting behavior is desirable if the rules serve the same purpose.
For instance, all of the firewall rules have specific names, so if an administrator can copy these rules to a GPO, and the rules will override the local versions on a local computer.
GPOs can have precedence.
So if an administrator has a different or more specific rule with the same name in a higher-precedence GPO, then it overrides other rules that exist.
The default value is a randomly assigned value.
When the defaults for main mode encryption need to overridden, specify the customized parameters and set this parameter, making it the new default setting for encryption.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: ByName
Aliases: ID

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -NewDisplayName
Specifies the new display name for a firewall rule.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -OverrideBlockRules
Indicates that matching network traffic that would otherwise be blocked is allowed.
The network traffic must be authenticated by using a separate IPsec rule.
If the *Direction* parameter is set to Inbound, then this parameter is valid only for rules that have one or more accounts listed in the *RemoteUser* parameter and optionally the *RemoteMachine* parameter.
Network packets that match this rule and that are successfully authenticated against a computer account specified in the *RemoteUser* parameter and against a user account identified in the *RemoteMachine* parameter are permitted through the firewall.
If this parameter is specified, then the *Authentication* parameter cannot be set to NotRequired.
This parameter is equivalent to the override block rules checkbox in the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security MMC snap-in.
For computers that are running WindowsÂ® 7 or nextref_server_7, this parameter is permitted on an outbound rule.
Selecting this parameter on an outbound rule causes matching traffic to be permitted through this rule even if other matching rules would block the traffic.
No accounts are required in the *RemoteMachine* or *RemoteUser* parameter for an outbound bypass rule, however, if authorized or excepted computers are listed in those groups the rules will be enforced.
This parameter is not valid on outbound rules on computers that are running firstref_vista or earlier.
Querying for rules with this parameter can only be performed using filter objects.
See the Get-NetFirewallSecurityFilter cmdlet for more information.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Owner
Specifies that matching firewall rules of the indicated owner are modified.
This parameter specifies the owner of the firewall rule, represented as an SDDL string.
All Windows Store applications that require network traffic create network isolation rules (normally through installing via the Store), where the user that installed the application is the owner.
This parameter specifies that only network packets that are authenticated as coming from or going to an owner identified in the list of accounts (SID) match this rule.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Package
Specifies the Windows Store application to which the firewall rule applies.
This parameter is specified as a security identifier (SID).
Querying for rules with this parameter can only be performed using filter objects.
See the Get-NetFirewallApplicationFilter cmdlet for more information.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -PassThru
Returns an object representing the item with which you are working.
By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Platform
Specifies which version of Windows the associated rule applies.
The acceptable format for this parameter is a number in the Major.Minor format.
The version number of 6.0 corresponds to Vista (nextref_vista), 6.1 corresponds to Win7 (WindowsÂ® 7 or firstref_longhorn), and 6.2 corresponds to Win8 (WindowsÂ® 8 or Windows Server 2012).
If + is not specified, then only that version is associated.
If + is specified, then that version and later versions are associated.
Querying for rules with this parameter with the Get-NetFirewallRule cmdlet cannot be performed.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -PolicyStore
Specifies the policy store from which to retrieve the rules to be modified.
A policy store is a container for firewall and IPsec policy.
The acceptable values for this parameter are:

- PersistentStore: Sometimes called static rules, this store contains the persistent policy for the local computer.
This policy is not from GPOs, and has been created manually or programmatically (during application installation) on the computer.
Rules created in this store are attached to the ActiveStore and activated on the computer immediately.
- ActiveStore: This store contains the currently active policy, which is the sum of all policy stores that apply to the computer.
This is the resultant set of policy (RSOP) for the local computer (the sum of all GPOs that apply to the computer), and the local stores (the PersistentStore, the static Windows service hardening (WSH), and the configurable WSH).
---- GPOs are also policy stores.
Computer GPOs can be specified as follows.
------ `-PolicyStore hostname`.
---- Active Directory GPOs can be specified as follows.
------ `-PolicyStore domain.fqdn.com\GPO_Friendly_Namedomain.fqdn.comGPO_Friendly_Name`.
------ Such as the following.
-------- `-PolicyStore localhost`
-------- `-PolicyStore corp.contoso.com\FirewallPolicy`
---- Active Directory GPOs can be created using the **New-GPO** cmdlet or the Group Policy Management Console.
- RSOP: This read-only store contains the sum of all GPOs applied to the local computer.
- SystemDefaults: This read-only store contains the default state of firewall rules that ship with Windows Server 2012.
- StaticServiceStore: This read-only store contains all the service restrictions that ship with Windows.
Optional and product-dependent features are considered part of Windows Server 2012 for the purposes of WFAS.
- ConfigurableServiceStore: This read-write store contains all the service restrictions that are added for third-party services.
In addition, network isolation rules that are created for Windows Store application containers will appear in this policy store.
The default value is PersistentStore.
This cmdlet cannot be used to add an object to a policy store.
An object can only be added to a policy store at creation time with the Copy-NetFirewallRule cmdlet or with the New-NetFirewallRule cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: ByName, ByDisplayName, ByDisplayGroup, ByGroup
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Profile
Specifies one or more profiles to which the rule is assigned.
The rule is active on the local computer only when the specified profile is currently active.
This relationship is many-to-many and can be indirectly modified by the user, by changing the Profiles field on instances of firewall rules.
Only one profile is applied at a time.
The acceptable values for this parameter are: Any, Domain, Private, Public, or NotApplicable.

The default value is Any.
Separate multiple entries with a comma and do not include any spaces.
Use the keyword Any to configure the profile as Private, Public, and Domain in the configurable service store.

```yaml
Type: Profile
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Accepted values: Any, Domain, Private, Public, NotApplicable

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Program
Specifies the path and file name of the program for which the rule allows traffic.
This is specified as the full path to an application file.
Querying for rules with this parameter can only be performed using filter objects.
See the Get-NetFirewallApplicationFilter cmdlet for more information.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Protocol
Specifies that network packets with matching IP addresses match this rule.
This parameter specifies the protocol for an IPsec rule.
The acceptable values for this parameter are:

- Protocols by number: 0 through 255.
- Protocols by name: TCP, UDP, ICMPv4, or ICMPv6.
If a port number is identified by using port1 or port2, then this parameter must be set to TCP or UDP.
The values ICMPv4 and ICMPv6 create a rule that exempts ICMP network traffic from the IPsec requirements of another rule.
The default value is Any.
Querying for rules with this parameter can only be performed using filter objects.
See the Get-NetFirewallPortFilter cmdlet for more information.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False

```

### -RemoteAddress
Specifies that network packets with matching IP addresses match this rule.
This parameter value is the second end point of an IPsec rule and specifies the computers that are subject to the requirements of this rule.
This parameter value is an IPv4 or IPv6 address, subnet, range, or the following keyword: Any.
The acceptable formats for this parameter are:
- Single IPv4 Address: 1.2.3.4
- Single IPv6 Address: fe80::1
- IPv4 Subnet (by network bit count): 1.2.3.4/24
- IPv6 Subnet (by network bit count): fe80::1/48
