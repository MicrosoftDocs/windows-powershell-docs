## DESCRIPTION
The **Set-NetFirewallSetting** cmdlet configures properties that apply to the firewall and IPsec settings, regardless of which network profile is currently in use.
This cmdlet allows the administrator to specify global firewall behavior.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
PS C:\>$nfSetting = Get-NetFirewallSetting -PolicyStore corp.contoso.com/gpo_name



PS C:\>Set-NetFirewallSetting -Exemptions RouterDiscovery -InputObject $nfSetting


This cmdlet can be run using only the pipeline.
PS C:\>Get-NetFirewallSetting -PolicyStore corp.contoso.com/gpo_name | Set-NetFirewallSetting -Exemptions RouterDiscovery
```

This example modifies the global firewall settings of a particular GPO policy store.

### EXAMPLE 2
```
PS C:\>$computers = New-Object -Typename System.Security.Principal.NTAccount ("corp.contoso.com" "SecureMachineName1")



PS C:\>$SIDofSecureComputerGroup = $computers.Translate([System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier]).Value



PS C:\>$SecureMachineGroupSDDL = "D:(A;;CC;;; $SIDofSecureComputerGroup)"



PS C:\>$nfSetting = Get-NetFirewallSetting -PolicyStore corp.contoso.com/gpo_name



PS C:\>Set-NetFirewallSetting -RemoteMachineTunnelAuthorizationList $SecureMachineGroupSDDL -InputObject $nfSetting


This cmdlet can be run using only the pipeline.
PS C:\>Get-NetFirewallSetting -PolicyStore corp.contoso.com/gpo_name | Set-NetFirewallSetting -RemoteMachineTunnelAuthorizationList $SecureMachineGroupSDDL
```

This example allows authorization to override the per-rule basis and to be done at the IPsec layer in a GPO.

## PARAMETERS

### -AllowIPsecThroughNAT
Specifies that IPsec configures a security association (SA) when one or both computers involved are behind a network address translation (NAT) device.
This setting indicates on which side NAT traversal should be attempted.
The acceptable values for this parameter are: None, Server, Both, or NotConfigured.

- None: Specifies that an SA cannot be negotiated if the server or client computer is behind a NAT device.
- Server: Specifies that an SA can be negotiated if only the server is on a private subnet behind a NAT device.
- Both: Specifies that an SA can be negotiated if the client or server or both of the computers are on private subnets behind one or more NAT devices.
- NotConfigured: Valid only when configuring a GPO.
Removes the setting from the GPO, which results in the policy not changing the value on the computer when the policy is applied.

The default value is None.
When managing a GPO, the default setting is NotConfigured.

```yaml
Type: IPsecThroughNAT
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Accepted values: None, Server, Both, NotConfigured

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AsJob
Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -CertValidationLevel
Specifies that IPsec checks the certificates used in authentication against a certificate revocation list (CRL), and how IPsec reacts to a certificate that is found to be on a CRL.
The acceptable values for this parameter are: None, AttemptCrlCheck, RequireCrlCheck, or NotConfigured.

- None: Specifies that IPsec does not perform any CRL checking.
- AttemptCrlCheck: Specifies that IPsec authentication fails only if the certificate is found to be revoked.
- RequireCrlCheck: Specifies that IPsec authentication fails if there is any error during CRL checking, including a failure to retrieve the CRL.
- NotConfigured: Valid only when configuring a GPO.
Removes the setting from the GPO, which results in the policy not changing the value on the computer when the policy is applied.

The default value is None.
When managing a GPO, the default setting is NotConfigured.

```yaml
Type: CRLCheck
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Accepted values: None, AttemptCrlCheck, RequireCrlCheck, NotConfigured

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -CimSession
Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
The default is the current session on the local computer.

```yaml
Type: CimSession[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: Session

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -EnablePacketQueuing
Specifies how the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security handles packet queuing.
This parameter enables inbound or forward packet queuing independently, allowing the computer is able to evenly distribute CPU load to multiple CPUs for site-to-site IPsec tunnel scenarios.
The acceptable values for this parameter are: None, Inbound, Forward, or NotConfigured.

- None: The firewall tracks the port numbers specified in PORT command requests and in the responses to PASV requests, and then allows the incoming FTP data traffic entering on the requested port number.
- Inbound: Inbound packet queuing is enabled.
- Forward: Forward packet queuing is enabled.
- NotConfigured: Valid only when configuring a GPO.
Removes the setting from the GPO, which results in the policy not changing the value on the computer when the policy is applied.

The default value when managing a computer running Windows ServerÂ® 2012 is None.
When managing a Group Policy Object (GPO), the default setting is NotConfigured.

```yaml
Type: PacketQueuing
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Accepted values: None, Inbound, Forward, NotConfigured

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -EnableStatefulFtp
Configures how Windows Firewall with Advanced Security handles FTP traffic that uses an initial connection on one port to request a data connection on a different port.
This affects both active and passive FTP.
If active FTP is used, then the client initiates a connection to the server on TCP port 21 and includes a PORT command that indicates to the FTP server the port number on which it should respond.
A typical firewall on the client would block this new connection as unsolicited inbound traffic since the packets to the new port are not in response to a request from that port.
If passive FTP is used, then the client initiates a connection to the server on TCP port 21 and includes the PASV command.
The server responds on TCP port 21 with a port number that the client must use for subsequent data transfer.
The client then initiates a connection to the server on the specified port.
A typical firewall on the FTP server would block this new incoming data connection as unsolicited inbound traffic since the packets received at the new port are not in response to a request from that port.
When this parameter is True, the firewall examines the PORT and PASV requests for these other port numbers and then allows the corresponding data connection to the port number that was requested.
- True: The firewall tracks the port numbers specified in PORT command requests and in the responses to PASV requests, and then allows the incoming FTP data traffic entering on the requested port number.
- False: The firewall does not track outgoing PORT commands or PASV responses, and so incoming data connections on the PORT or PASV requested port is blocked as an unsolicited incoming connection.
- NotConfigured: Valid only when configuring a GPO.
Removes the setting from the GPO, which results in the policy not changing the value on the computer when the policy is applied.
The default value is False.
The default value when managing a computer running firstref_vista or firstref_client_7 is True.
The default value when managing a computer running firstref_longhorn or firstref_server_7 is False.
When managing a Group Policy Object (GPO), the default value is NotConfigured.

```yaml
Type: GpoBoolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Accepted values: False, True, NotConfigured

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -EnableStatefulPptp
Configures how Windows Firewall with Advanced Security handles PPTP traffic.
If a connection is made through TCP port 1723 in nextref_vista, then Windows Firewall recognizes the connection as being established through PPTP.
By default, Windows Firewall uses a stateful PPTP protocol analyzer to determine whether it can receive packets through the TCP port 1723 connection.
Therefore, the stateful PPTP protocol analyzer may reject as not valid any traffic that uses a protocol other than PPTP.
- True: The firewall examines the packets from port 1723 and determines whether the traffic is valid PPTP traffic.
- False: The firewall does not examine the packets from port 1723 to determine whether the traffic is valid PPTP traffic.
- NotConfigured: Valid only when configuring a GPO.
Removes the setting from the GPO, which results in the policy not changing the value on the computer when the policy is applied.
The default value is False.
When managing a GPO, the default value is NotConfigured.

```yaml
Type: GpoBoolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Accepted values: False, True, NotConfigured

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Exemptions
Specifies the protocols to be exempted from IPsec requirements.
The acceptable values for this parameter are: None, NeighborDiscovery, Icmp, RouterDiscovery, Dhcp, or NotConfigured.

- None: No protocols are exempted.
- NeighborDiscovery: Exempt IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol traffic.
- Icmp: Exempt ICMP, for both IPv4 and IPv6, protocol traffic.
This option is available on computers that are running WindowsÂ® 7 or nextref_server_7.
- RouterDiscovery: Exempt router discovery traffic.
- Dhcp: Exempt DHCP, for both IPv4 and IPv6, protocol traffic.
This option is available on computers that are running WindowsÂ® 7 or nextref_server_7.
The default value when managing a local computer that is running WindowsÂ® 7 or nextref_server_7 is NeighborDiscovery,Dhcp.
The default value when managing a local computer that is running nextref_vista, nextref_longhorn, Windows XPÂ®, or Windows ServerÂ® 2003 is NeighborDiscovery.

The default value when managing a GPO is NotConfigured.

```yaml
Type: TrafficExemption
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Accepted values: None, NeighborDiscovery, Icmp, RouterDiscovery, Dhcp, NotConfigured

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -GPOSession
Specifies the network GPO from which to retrieve the rules to be modified.
This parameter is used in the same way as the *PolicyStore* parameter.
When modifying GPOs in Windows PowerShellÂ®, each change to a GPO requires the entire GPO to be loaded, modified, and saved back.
On a busy Domain Controller (DC), this can be a slow and resource-heavy operation.
A GPO Session loads a domain GPO onto the local computer and makes all changes in a batch, before saving it back.
This reduces the load on the DC and speeds up the Windows PowerShell cmdlets.
To load a GPO Session, use the Open-NetGPO cmdlet.
To save a GPO Session, use the Save-NetGPO cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: Query (cdxml)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -InputObject
Specifies the input object that is used in a pipeline command.

```yaml
Type: CimInstance[]
Parameter Sets: InputObject (cdxml)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -KeyEncoding
Specifies the type of key encoding to be used.
The acceptable values for this parameter are: UTF16 or UTF8.
The default value is UTF8.

```yaml
Type: KeyEncoding
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Accepted values: UTF16, UTF8, NotConfigured

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -MaxSAIdleTimeSeconds
Specifies the number of minutes that a security association (SA) can stay idle before being deleted.
Once deleted, a new SA must be established before computers under the scope of the original SA can communicate again.
The acceptable values for this parameter are: 300 through 3600 seconds, or NotConfigured.

- A non-zero value, including 300 through 3600, specifies the desired lifetime.
- NotConfigured: Valid only when configuring a GPO.
Removes the setting from the GPO, which results in the policy not changing the value on the computer when the policy is applied.
This parameter value is case-sensitive and NotConfigured can only be specified using dot-notation.

The default value when managing a local computer is 300 seconds (5 minutes).
When managing a GPO, the default value is NotConfigured.

```yaml
Type: UInt32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -PassThru
Returns an object representing the item with which you are working.
By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -PolicyStore
Specifies the policy store from which to retrieve the rules to be modified.
A policy store is a container for firewall and IPsec policy.
The acceptable values for this parameter are:

- PersistentStore: Sometimes called static rules, this store contains the persistent policy for the local computer.
This policy is not from GPOs, and has been created manually or programmatically (during application installation) on the computer.
Rules created in this store are attached to the ActiveStore and activated on the computer immediately.
- ActiveStore: This store contains the currently active policy, which is the sum of all policy stores that apply to the computer.
This is the resultant set of policy (RSOP) for the local computer (the sum of all GPOs that apply to the computer), and the local stores (the PersistentStore, the static Windows service hardening (WSH), and the configurable WSH).
---- GPOs are also policy stores.
Computer GPOs can be specified as follows.
------ `-PolicyStore hostname`.
---- Active Directory GPOs can be specified as follows.
------ `-PolicyStore domain.fqdn.com\GPO_Friendly_Namedomain.fqdn.comGPO_Friendly_Name`.
------ Such as the following.
-------- `-PolicyStore localhost`
-------- `-PolicyStore corp.contoso.com\FirewallPolicy`
---- Active Directory GPOs can be created using the **New-GPO** cmdlet or the Group Policy Management Console.
- RSOP: This read-only store contains the sum of all GPOs applied to the local computer.
- SystemDefaults: This read-only store contains the default state of firewall rules that ship with Windows Server 2012.
- StaticServiceStore: This read-only store contains all the service restrictions that ship with Windows Server 2012.
Optional and product-dependent features are considered part of Windows Server 2012 for the purposes of WFAS.
- ConfigurableServiceStore: This read-write store contains all the service restrictions that are added for third-party services.
In addition, network isolation rules that are created for Windows Store application containers will appear in this policy store.
The default value is PersistentStore.
The Set-NetFirewallRule cmdlet cannot be used to add an object to a policy store.
An object can only be added to a policy store at creation time with the Copy-NetFirewallRule cmdlet or with the New-NetFirewallRule cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: Query (cdxml)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RemoteMachineTransportAuthorizationList
Specifies the computer accounts that are authorized to establish transport connections to the local computer that match this rule.
Authorization can override the per-rule basis and be done at the IPsec layer.
The acceptable values for this parameter are:

- None: Specifies that access to the tunnel is not restricted based on computer account.
- \<SDDL string\>: A string that identifies accounts and the permissions granted or denied to those accounts.
This parameter value is valid on computers that are running WindowsÂ® 7, nextref_server_7, and Windows Server 2012 only, and is ignored on earlier versions of Windows.

### -RequireFullAuthSupport
Ignores key modules that do not support all of the authentication types present in a rule.
If this parameter is set to True, then the behavior is the same as nextref_vista and WindowsÂ® 7, that the key modules that do not support the entire authentication set will be ignored.
If this parameter is set to False, then the keying modules will try with the subset of configured authentication types that are allowed.
