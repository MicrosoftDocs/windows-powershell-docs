# Add-NetSwitchTeamMember

## SYNOPSIS
Adds a network adapter member to an existing switch team.

## SYNTAX

```
Add-NetSwitchTeamMember [-Name] <String> [-Team] <String> [-CimSession <CimSession[]>] [-ThrottleLimit <Int32>]
 [-AsJob] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Add-NetSwitchTeamMember** cmdlet adds a network adapter member to an existing switch team.
The switch team algorithms are part of the forward extension in a Hyper-V extensible switch.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Add a network adapter to a team
```
PS C:\> Add-NetSwitchTeamMember -Team "SwitchTeam01" -Name "Ethernet 2"
```

This command adds the network adapter named Ethernet 2 as a member of team named SwitchTeam01.

## PARAMETERS

### -AsJob
Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to complete.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -CimSession
Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
The default is the current session on the local computer.

```yaml
Type: CimSession[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: Session

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Name
Specifies one or more names of network adapters to be added to the switch team.
Wildcard characters are allowed.
Network adapter names are the **IfAlias** names, such as Ethernet 3.
Only wired adapters that are not part of another team, switch team, or Load-Balancing/Fail-Over team can be added.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Team
Specifies the name of the switch team to which to add a network adapter.
The switch team must already exist.

The team name cannot be a NetLbfo team name.
Use the NIC Teaming (NetLBFO) Cmdlets in Windows PowerShell cmdlets for a NetLbfo team.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ThrottleLimit
Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet.
If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters
This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable.
