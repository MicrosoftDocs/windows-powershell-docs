# Add-RemoteAccessLoadBalancerNode

## SYNOPSIS
Adds a server to the load balancing cluster.

## SYNTAX

```
Add-RemoteAccessLoadBalancerNode [-RemoteAccessServer] <String> [-InternalInterface <String>]
 [-InternetInterface <String>] [-VpnIPAddressRange <String[]>] [-ComputerName <String>] [-Force] [-PassThru]
 [-CimSession <CimSession[]>] [-ThrottleLimit <Int32>] [-AsJob] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Add-RemoteAccessLoadBalancerNode** cmdlet adds a server to the load balanced cluster:

 -- The server is added to the cluster to which the server on which the cmdlet is run, or to the server specified in the **ComputerName** parameter.

 -- When a server is added to cluster, Remote Access settings are replicated on the server to match the other servers in the cluster.
The Remote Access role and the Network Load Balancing (NLB) role should be installed on the server before adding it to the cluster.

 -- The internal and external adapters can be specified manually.
If no parameters are specified, then the cmdlet will attempt to detect settings automatically.

 -- The IPv6 prefix for IP-HTTPS should be `59` bits.
If IPv6 addressing is used for VPN, then the IPv6 prefix should be `59` bits.

 -- All the designed IPs on the server being added to the cluster must be in the same subnet as other servers in the cluster.

 -- If self-signed certificates are not being used, then certificates for IP-HTTPS and network location server (NLS) (if NLS is on DirectAccess (DA) Server) must be present on the new server.
Note: The subject name of certificate must be same as the respective certificates on the other computers in the cluster.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
Create a load balanced cluster using the Set-RemoteAccessLoadBalancer cmdlet.
PS C:\>Set-RemoteAccessLoadBalancer -InternetDedicatedIPAddress "131.107.0.20/255.255.255.0" -InternalDedicatedIPAddress @("3ffe::2/64","10.0.0.2/255.255.255.0") -InternetVirtualIPAddress @("131.107.0.5/255.255.255.0","131.107.0.15/255.255.255.0") -InternalVirtualIPAddress @("3ffe::5/64","10.0.0.5/255.255.255.0")


Add the Edge2 server as a new node in this load balanced cluster.
PS C:\>$RemoteAccessNLB = Add-RemoteAccessLoadBalancerNode -RemoteAccessServer Edge2.corp.contoso.com -PassThru
Confirm
Certificate Iphttps cannot be located on the Remote Access server. Do you want DirectAccess to create and use a self-signed certificate?

[Y] Yes  [N] No  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "Y"): Y

Confirm
Certificate NLS cannot be located on the Remote Access server. Do you want DirectAccess to create and use a self-signed certificate?

[Y] Yes  [N] No  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "Y"): Y

WARNING: When adding a server (running the network location server using a self-signed certificate) to a cluster, point the network location server DNS entry to the internal DIP of each cluster server. After GPO updates, update the DNS entry again to the cluster VIP.

The cmdlet is run on Edge1 server and therefore the Edge2 server is added to the same cluster as the Edge1 server as shown in output of NlbNodeStatus.
PS C:\>$RemoteAccessNLB.NlbNodeStatus
{EDGE1.CORP.CONTOSO.COM, EDGE2.CORP.CONTOSO.COM}
```

This example creates a NLB Cluster and adding a new server to a load balanced cluster.

### EXAMPLE 2
```
If VPN is enabled, define a static address range for VPN. If this is being used in a script and the prompts are to be suppressed, then run this cmdlet with the **Force** parameter.
PS C:\>Add-RemoteAccessLoadBalancerNode -RemoteAccessServer edge3 -VpnIPAddressRange @("192.168.1.1","192.168.1.100") -PassThru
Confirm
Certificate Iphttps cannot be located on the Remote Access server. Do you want DirectAccess to create and use a self-signed certificate?

[Y] Yes  [N] No  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "Y"): Y

Confirm
Certificate NLS cannot be located on the Remote Access server. Do you want DirectAccess to create and use a self-signed certificate?

[Y] Yes  [N] No  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "Y"): Y

WARNING: When adding a server (running the network location server using a self-signed certificate) to a cluster, point the network location server DNS entry to the internal DIP of each cluster server. After GPO updates, update the DNS entry again to the cluster VIP.

HostName       : EDGE3
StatusCode     : In Progress
IPAddressRange :
IPv6Prefix     :
```

This example adds a new server to a load balanced cluster with VPN enabled.

## PARAMETERS

Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -CimSession
Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.
