## DESCRIPTION
The **Remove-DAAppServer** cmdlet removes the specified list of application server security groups (SGs) from the DirectAccess (DA) deployment, removes the specified application servers from the specified DA application server SG,and removes the application server Group Policy Objects (GPOs) in the specified domains.
This cmdlet is not applicable when DA is deployed only for the management of remote clients.

The basic paradigm is that all application server GPOs always contain all SGs even if all the corresponding domains are not represented in all the SGs.
There will never be a scenario where an SG is present only in some of the GPOs.
If this happens, then it means that the configuration is in a bad state.

The application server SG and GPO parameters are treated as independent entities.
A user can remove application server GPOs independent of the SGs and the domains where these SGs exist.
Every SG that is removed from the DA deployment is removed from all application server GPOs currently present.

The following additional capabilities of this cmdlet justify its need though AD cmdlets are already available for the deletion of SGs and GPOs.

 -- When an SG is removed it is removed in all GPOs.
Additionally, if user does not have permissions to edit a GPO the SG is not removed from any of the GPOs.
When using the AD cmdlet user would have to carefully ensure that it is run for each of the domains and it is difficult to handle the case where he does not have permissions on some domains.

 -- With the above described paradigm there is still a need to parse an SG to remove independent application servers in the SG because every application server has a unique IP address that is used in the client policy that needs to be removed.
This functionality is handled by this cmdlet.

 -- When a GPO is removed all SGs are removed from the GPO and the application server specific policies are also removed.
The cmdlet takes care of the conditions where the GPO is removed only if it was originally created at the time of adding.
If the GPO is already present at the time of adding, then it is merely edited.

App Server configuration is a global configuration and is applicable to all DA servers in the enterprise deployment even when there is multi-site enterprise deployment.

Following are additional behavioral notes for this cmdlet.

 -- If a nested SG has to be removed, then the cmdlet recursively parses the SG so that all servers are retrieved and policies can be removed accordingly.

 -- Removing a domain deletes the application server GPO only if it was created at the time of addition.
If it was already present, then only the DA related policies and settings are wiped out and the GPO is left intact.

 -- Deletion of all app server GPOs and SGs is a permitted operation.

 -- When removing SGs if the user does not have the permissions to configure even one app server GPO among the many that might be present, then this cmdlet terminates the processing of the entire list of SGs specified.
However, this cmdlet still processes any GPOs that the user might have specified to remove.

 -- When removing GPOs if the user does not have the permissions to remove or configure one of the specified GPOs, then the cmdlet still proceeds with the processing of the remaining GPOs in the list.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
PS C:\>Remove-DAAppServer -SecurityGroupNameList daAppServerGrp
SecurityGroupNameList:
GpoName  :
ConnectionType : E2EAuthOnlyToAppServer
TrafficProtection : Enabled
```

This example deletes the daAppServerGrp SG from all GPOs.
In current setup, daAppServerGrp was the only SG present, therefore the application server GPO (such as corp.contoso.com\DirectAccess Application Server Settings) is also removed automatically.

### EXAMPLE 2
```
PS C:\>Remove-DAAppServer -SecurityGroupName daAppServerGrp -Name "da-test-0807"
```

This example deletes the computer named da-test-0807 from SG daAppServerGrp.
The SG continues to be a part of DA Configuration.

### EXAMPLE 3
```
PS C:\>Remove-DAAppServer -DomainName "corp.contoso.com"
SecurityGroupNameList:
GpoName  :
ConnectionType : E2EAuthOnlyToAppServer
TrafficProtection : Enabled
```

This example removes the application server GPO in the DA configuration from the corp.contoso.com domain.

## PARAMETERS

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -CimSession
Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer.
Enter a computer name or a session object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227967) or [Get-CimSession](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=227966) cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: Cn

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)

If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.
