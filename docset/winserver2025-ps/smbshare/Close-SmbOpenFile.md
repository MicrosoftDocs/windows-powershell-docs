## DESCRIPTION
The **Close-SmbOpenFile** cmdlet forcibly closes a file that is open by one of the clients of the Server Message Block (SMB) server.
This cmdlet can cause data loss to the client for which the file is being closed if the client has not flushed all of the file modifications back to the server before the file is closed.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Close an open file
```powershell
PS C:\> Close-SmbOpenFile -FileId 4415226383589
```

```

This command closes a file identified as 4415226383589 that is open by one of the clients of the SMB server.

### Example 2: Close open files for a session
```powershell
