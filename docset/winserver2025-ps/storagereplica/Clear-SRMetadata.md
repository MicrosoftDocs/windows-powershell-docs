# Clear-SRMetadata

## SYNOPSIS
Removes unreferenced Storage Replica metadata.

## SYNTAX

### RG (Default)
```
Clear-SRMetadata [[-ComputerName] <String>] [-NoRestart] [-Force] [-Name] <String> [-Logs] [-Partition]
 [-CimSession <CimSession[]>] [-ThrottleLimit <Int32>] [-AsJob] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### AllServer
```
Clear-SRMetadata [[-ComputerName] <String>] [-AllConfiguration] [-AllLogs] [-AllPartitions] [-NoRestart]
 [-Force] [-CimSession <CimSession[]>] [-ThrottleLimit <Int32>] [-AsJob] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Clear-SRMetadata** cmdlet removes unreferenced Storage Replica metadata from the registry, partition, and System Volume Information folder.
This orphaned metadata may exist after a failed partnership or replication group removal.

Do not run this cmdlet unless you have already tried to clean up by using the Remove-SRPartnership and Remove-SRGroup cmdlets.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Delete all unreferenced log files
```
PS C:\>Clear-SRMetadata -AllLogs
Confirm
Are you sure you want to perform this action?
Clearing orphaned log files from Storage Replica log container. Are you sure you want to continue?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "Y"): y
```

This command deletes all unreferenced log files from all log volumes on the computer.

### Example 2: Delete unreferenced log files partition database entries
```
PS C:\>Clear-SRMetadata -AllLogs -AllPartitions -Verbose
Confirm
Are you sure you want to perform this action?
Clearing orphaned log files from Storage Replica log container. Are you sure you want to continue?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "Y"):
VERBOSE: Looking for orphaned Storage Replica logs on volume \\?\Volume{c9406624-d9e8-489d-9f29-e95c02bc13f9}\...
VERBOSE: 1 orphaned log directories were deleted.
VERBOSE: 4 orphaned log files were deleted.
VERBOSE: Looking for orphaned records in Storage Replica partition database.
VERBOSE: No orphan records found in Storage Replica partition database.
```

This command deletes all unreferenced log files from all log volumes and unreferenced partition database entries from all data volumes on the computer.
In this example you see that several log files were deleted.

### Example 3: Clear logs for a replication group
```
This command gets the name of all the replication groups on the current computer by using the Format-List cmdlet. There is only one replication group on this computer.
PS C:\>Get-SRGroup | Format-List -Property "name"
Name               : ReplicationGroup01

This command clears all logs for a replication group found in the first command. The command reports verbose output.
PS C:\>Clear-SRMetadata -Name "ReplicationGroup01" -Logs -Verbose
Confirm
Are you sure you want to perform this action?
Clearing orphaned log files from Storage Replica log container. Are you sure you want to continue?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "Y"): y
VERBOSE: Looking for orphaned Storage Replica logs on volume e:\...
VERBOSE: 1 orphaned log directories were deleted.
VERBOSE: 16 orphaned log files were deleted.
```

This example clears all logs for a specific replication group and reports verbose output.

If this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShellÂ® calculates an optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the computer.
The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the computer.
