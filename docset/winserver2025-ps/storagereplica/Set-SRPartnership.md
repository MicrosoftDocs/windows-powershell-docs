## DESCRIPTION

The `Set-SRPartnership` cmdlet modifies a replication partnership between two existing replication
groups. You can use this cmdlet to add replicated volumes. You can also change the direction of
replication which makes a source volume into a destination volume.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Reverse replication direction

```powershell
$Parameters = @{
    NewSourceComputerName = 'SR-SRV06'
    SourceRGName = 'ReplicationGroup02'
    DestinationComputerName = 'SR-SRV05'
    DestinationRGName = 'ReplicationGroup01'
    Confirm = $False
}
Set-SRPartnership @Parameters
```

This example changes the replication direction without user confirmation, for example after a
disaster recovery event has occurred. The previous source replication group named
`ReplicationGroup01` on previous source server `SR-SRV05` becomes the new destination for
`ReplicationGroup02` on `SR-SRV06`. Replication is now reversed. You must direct any applications
or users attempting to read or write against `SR-SRV05` to `SR-SRV06`.

This example uses splatting to pass parameter values from the `$Parameters` variable to the command.
Learn more about [Splatting](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_splatting).

### Example 2: Change size of log

```powershell
$Parameters = @{
    SourceComputerName = 'SR-SRV05'
    SourceRGName = 'ReplicationGroup01'
    DestinationComputerName = 'SR-SRV06'
    DestinationRGName = 'ReplicationGroup02'
    LogSizeInBytes = '32GB'
}
Set-SRPartnership @Parameters
Get-SRPartnership | Get-SRGroup
```

The example changes the log from its default size of 8GB to 32GB, for the partnership between
`SR-SRV05` and `SR-SRV06`.

### Example 3: Change to asynchronous mode

```powershell
$Parameters = @{
    SourceComputerName = 'SR-SRV05'
    SourceRGName = 'ReplicationGroup01'
    ReplicationMode = 'Asynchronous'
    DestinationComputerName = 'SR-SRV06'
    DestinationRGName = 'ReplicationGroup02'
}
Set-SRPartnership @Parameters
```

This example changes the replication mode from synchronous to asynchronous. A warning will be
generated by the setting being applied to both replication groups.

### Example 4: Display replicas after a change

```powershell
$Parameters = @{
    SourceComputerName = 'SR-SRV05'
    SourceRGName = 'ReplicationGroup01'
    SourceAddVolumePartnership = 'F:','G:'
    DestinationComputerName = 'SR-SRV06'
    DestinationRGName = 'ReplicationGroup02'
    DestinationAddVolumePartnership = 'F:','G:'
}
Set-SRPartnership @Parameters
(Get-SRGroup).replicas
```

The first command changes the partnership for the servers named `SR-SRV05` and `SR-SRV06`. The
second command gets all replication groups for the current computer by using the `Get-SRGroup`
cmdlet. The command displays all the replicas.

## PARAMETERS

### -AsJob

Runs the cmdlet as a background job. Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to
complete.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AsyncRPO

Specifies the maximum difference in time that data for an asynchronous partnership can be different
between source and destination. This is a Recovery Point Objective. The default value is 30 seconds.

After this time is exceeded, the source server alerts the Health Service on clusters. It logs event
1239 in the Storage Replica Admin event log channel. If the RPO time is lower than the configured
time, event 1240 is logged. Changing this value modifies monitoring and logging. It does not affect
replication or Input/Output.

```yaml
Type: UInt32
Parameter Sets: ModifySettings
Aliases: RPO

Required: False
Position: 51
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -CimSession

Runs the cmdlet in a remote session or on a remote computer. Enter a computer name or a session
object, such as the output of a [New-CimSession](/powershell/module/cimcmdlets/new-cimsession) or
[Get-CimSession](/powershell/module/cimcmdlets/get-cimsession) cmdlet. The default is the current
session on the local computer.

```yaml
Type: CimSession[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: Session

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Compression

Indicates that the connections in this partnership should use SMB compression for data transfer.
SMB compression is only used with TCP, and isn't supported on both SMB Direct and RDMA networks.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: ModifySettings
Aliases: CMP

Required: False
Position: 53
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DestinationAddVolumePartnership

Specifies an array of drive letters or mount point paths of partitions to add to the existing
replication group. You cannot specify paths already added to the replication group.

This list is ordered. The order of volumes determines the order of replication. For more
information, see the **DestinationVolumeName** parameter of the `New-SRPartnership` cmdlet.

We do not recommend replicating different drive letters or mount point paths.
The practice can cause application failures because of stored settings after a failover occurs.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: AddVolumes
Aliases: DAV

Required: True
Position: 6
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DestinationComputerName

Specifies a single replica host computer NetBIOS name or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the
destination computer.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: DCN

Required: True
Position: 3
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DestinationRGName

Specifies the name of the destination replication group.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: DGN

Required: True
Position: 5
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Encryption

Indicates that the connections on this partnership should be encrypted by using SMB AES-128-GCM.
Enabling encryption can protect Storage Replica block transfers from man-in-the-middle interception
or reading. Enabling encryption can decrease replication and write Input/Output performance.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: ModifySettings
Aliases: ENC

Required: False
Position: 52
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Force

Forces the command to run without asking for user confirmation.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: AddVolumes, ModifyPartnership
Aliases: F

Required: False
Position: 100
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -LogSizeInBytes

Specifies the aggregate size of log files on each server in the replication group for the volumes
that are associated with this replication group. The minimum size 512MB. You can specify a value by
using the Windows PowerShell byte conversion capability, such as 4GB or 3200MB. A value that is too
small may cause decreased replication performance or increased recovery time after an interruption
between computers.

```yaml
Type: UInt64
Parameter Sets: ModifySettings
Aliases: LS

Required: False
Position: 50
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -NewSourceComputerName

Specifies the new source of replication. This parameter changes the direction of replication for the
source computer and the source replication group. When changed, replication stops originating on the
current source and moves to the new source.

This operation is very likely to disrupt access to data. There is a time when neither volumes are
writable and when clients and applications might still access the previously writable source volume.
You may also have to reconfigure applications and repoint users to this new location, using
technologies such as DFS Namespaces. When switching asynchronously-replicated volumes, to avoid data
loss, you must first make sure that user and application data is quiescent.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: ModifyPartnership
Aliases: NSCN

Required: False
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ReplicationMode

Specifies the desired mode of replication for this source and destination pair. The acceptable
values for this parameter are:

- Synchronous or 1. The synchronous mode requires all writes to commit on the destination server and
  commit on the source server, which guarantees data integrity between computers.
- Asynchronous or 2. The asynchronous mode writes to the source server without waiting for the
  server, which allows for replication over high latency, geographic networks.

The default value is synchronous. The default asynchronous recovery point alert time is 30 seconds.
You can modify it by using this cmdlet. The alert time has no effect on replication behavior, only
on reporting.

```yaml
Type: ReplicationMode
Parameter Sets: ModifySettings
Aliases: RM
Accepted values: Synchronous, Asynchronous

Required: False
Position: 8
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Seeded

Indicates that the destination server contains a seeded copy of the data from the source server.
Seeded data is defined as a copy of data from the source server that has a high similarity, such as
mostly empty blocks, restoring a recent backup, or shipping cloned copies of disks to the
destination server.

Seeding is most effective when using a previous copy of the storage, such as a split mirror or
previously replicated drives, or when the storage is mostly empty and was always empty, such as a
recently initialized drive with a newly formatted volume. Seeding is somewhat effective with data
that came from a backup restore or a complete tree copy of data or from copies of very large files.

Seeding is least effective when copying many small files from some random locations to some other
random locations. Storage Replica automatically uses seeding when it restarts replication after a
long outage that wrapped the logs.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: AddVolumes
Aliases: S

Required: False
Position: 9
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SourceAddVolumePartnership

Specifies an array of drive letters or mount point paths of partitions to add to the existing
replication group. You cannot specify paths already added to the replication group.

This is an ordered list. The order of volumes determines the order of replication. For more
information, see the **DestinationVolumeName** parameter of the `New-SRPartnership` cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: AddVolumes
Aliases: SAV

Required: True
Position: 2
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SourceComputerName

Specifies a single replica host computer NetBIOS name or FQDN of the source computer.
The default value is the local computer.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: AddVolumes
Aliases: SCN

Required: False
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: ModifySettings
Aliases: SCN

Required: False
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SourceRGName

Specifies the name of the source replication group.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: SGN

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ThrottleLimit

Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be established to run the cmdlet. If
this parameter is omitted or a value of `0` is entered, then Windows PowerShell® calculates an
optimum throttle limit for the cmdlet based on the number of CIM cmdlets that are running on the
computer. The throttle limit applies only to the current cmdlet, not to the session or to the
computer.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm

Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf

Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
The cmdlet is not run.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
